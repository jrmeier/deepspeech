this is jack pot cast number twelve with the others and me dunkellin sometimes people as come what made me me how did i turn out like this
 where i come from and i go back and i i tone it you know hard cousin grown up and i being in that ocean where it was cold to be hard and
strong and it was about a presentation those are like the underlying theme so i point it at you know and i could that's real there was
    montani remember from those days that stuck with me my my whole life from him of those from some of that music with an there's other
 things that influenced me as a kid at even even a young race and one of the things that i know influence to be and a very young age in a
 police significant way was he in the movie bridge on the river qui which is a classic or move an atmore pretty much had it all for me and
 i think i can trace my ideas of being a command go and use that word you have kind of a arcata people don't use any more come and no but i
 i think i got it from watching that move without as a kid and if you haven't seen that movie you should check it out for sure because it's
 epic and it's a store of printers for ten american british most learned that ar symptom build the bridge in the middle of the jungle and
 burma for a train line that is to connect a bank cock and ring go in a course these are prisoners so there badly mistreated there beaten
 the poorly sad vente want american escapes and he lied thus a command no true back to the sight of the bridge to blow up the bridge and
 they do it all and the commandos in the movie they do all they perish you the end they swam up the river they lay demolition on the bridge
 like a team operation and one part of the plot though is that the senior british officer at the camp the senior prisoner at the camp the
 name in the in the movies a tenant colonel nicholson he takes a true leadership role in building the brick not think about that ease being
 cast by the japanese to build this bridge and instead of sabotaging the job because it's going to help the japanese he actually gets his
 men fired up and help for an eyes and has his engineers read a in it and they relocated to a better piece of train and any pushes his men
 to do good job building it and he actually takes pride in this bridge and again missus bridson to aid in japanese japanese domination so
 when the commandos show off to blow it up the colonel he he almost foils the attack but the end the bridge is destroyed the asimov and it
 was like i said i was very influential to me as a kid and people should definitely watch it and then you should know that it's all a lie a
 sweet what's all lie there well there really was a bridge on a river qui and it really was built by prisoners of war but that's about
 where the similarities and what the prisoners suffered at the hands of the imperial japanese guards is beyond anything that they showed in
 the movie and really beyond anything that even remotely civilized person could imagine i was oh i was overseas recently in europe and i
 was in britain and a friend of mine gave me a book called the forgotten highlander and he told me you know oh it's by one of the soldiers
 that built the bridge on the reacquire read it then i thought myself all gay you know great it's like the movie asad's not like the movies
 all like the boy at all and it isn't this is a book that shows the ultimate in human desiring and through that the ultimate and human will
 the arthur alce der orca was fresh in the british notary he was sent to sing a poor and when sing a polis overrun by the japanese imperial
 army he ended up in the jungle a princess and a slave by this time mental health had become a major issue on the railway we all suffered
 from depression man were taking their own lives are along the railway men cut their own throats put their heads on the railway line and
 simply walked into the jungle to die men developed the atap stare and just looked intently at the father of the hut death soon followed
 others went mad because a medical conditions caused by vitamin deistic encies and some just give up losing their minds and their self
 control they would fit with any one over nothing at all throwing punches biting kicking they need be controlled physically but just could
 not be calm down it came to a point where something drastic had to be done to prevent innocent men being killed by derange fellow
 prisoners some of whom had reverted to animal instincts but this is on was made to build our own lunatic asylum to kate poor souls with
 the agreement of the japanese the burial party built to six foot square bamboo cages the mad men could stand or lie down in these
 dettensee for my hut and they had a bench to sit on there rereived food and water but sadly were largely ignored at night it was awful to
 hear them in the darkness jabbering in the screaming throwing themselves at the cages the man who went in never came out alive death would
 have been welcome for them it was a dreadful thing to see our fellow human beings caged like animals but what else could we do you know as
 i was preparing for this in a lot of times when on putting notes together i'm thinking about this am saying that i'm going to say some
 comparable thing that i could bring back from some of my experiences and i got nothing for you i got me unfor you and this this book is
 just like that back to the book i turned to god to level times often i felt my prayers went on answered but i somehow lived through this
 madness and i think that some one must have been listening but faith and god could not prevent the beatings on the railway which would
 totally rotten the threat of a rifle but across your head or bambocciate your body for ever loomed large for no reason i'll wire whips
 with lashing to our backs and draw blood on guards would creep up on you and strike the open tropical odors on your legs with a bamboo
 deck causing intense agony often they don't liver at these beatings with such brutality and swiftness that you did not see them coming or
 even know that they were what they were for sometimes you just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time the corean guard took a
 certain pleasure in the beatings they had expressed permission to kill prisoners without any reference to hire authority but most of them
 would be satisfied to stop at the sight of the blood trickling the beatings of no matter how frequent never got easier to take in fact
 they got tougher each time i took a beating at chipaway not just at my bones and waning muscles but at my will to endure them the deliver
 the elena was weather to swallow your pride by going down at the first blow at retain some of your dignity by taking several blows and
 standing up to them if you re if you refuse to show that their blows are heard on you they would fly into wages and the beating could be
 severe even fatal from an early period the japanese camp commandant whom i called the black prince became ever more inventive with his
 punishments i could not imagine a more sedisti an evil person on the planet the more haines the so called to climb the sicker the sentence
 under his instructed under his instructions the guards had free rein if they felt you deserve something more than a beating it meant
 taking you aside and make you pick up a large bolter for the rest of the day you had to hold the rock over your head in the blazing heat
 within minutes your already weak and mannered arms would start to twitching tail you before long you would have to drop the rock you shall
 leave the size of a rugby ball or football mindful said you did so without letting it fall on your own skull when you let go the guards
 with pounds fists rifle butts and boots falling into your body until you picked up the rock again it would go on all day and if the
 japanese officers did not think you i learn your lesson sufficiently the punishment would be repeat repeated back at camp the black plants
 was a true basker others called him the can you kid i thought my name suited intendant luki will well he was darker than the other
 japanese soldiers and struggled like royalty his beefy gut protruding from beneath his shabby uniform he despised us totally we were scum
 to him his absolute power over us and capacity for pitilessness for pitiless brutality made him so terrifying to me lang before our
 decision to incarcerate crazy men the japanese had built her own cages the black holes as they were known were a higher form of punishment
 those fortune enough to be locked inside this sematos unfortunate enough to be locked inside the same the semi subterranean cages
 proportions or you could not stand like own or even kneel fully would be kept in for a month typically corrigan iron and metal covered the
 bamboo to intensify the heat and to pride victims of air and any cooling breeze few who went in came out alive ye it's ye eumenae
 unbelievable the black prince's right hand man was sergeant say che non to us breathily as doctor death short and squat he took the roll
 calls and carried out all of the camp commandant orders presumably he was more educated in the other japanese coreans but he was evil to
 the marrow mules and extreme he loved tormenting us he especially revelled than a sickening brand of the water torture he had guards pin
 down his hapless victim before pouring gallons of water down the prisoner's throat easing a bucket and hose the man stomach with the swell
 up from huge volumes of water he would win jump up and down gleefully on the pariser stomach sometimes the guards tied barbed wire round
 the poor soul stomach he survived when a pose was caught stealing from the japanese officers store room or if a man turned on a guard they
 received the next grade on the sliding scale of japanese torture i called that the indian rope trick one favoured by indians in the old
 cowboy films the helpless prisoner would be tattered spread eagle to the ground they wrapped wet raton the same string like bark used to
 lash our bambute around his ankles and wrists and tied him to stake in the ground as the return dried the ties which slowly dashit the
 skin drawing blood and erring in the cinerator age as it pulled limbs from their sockets it reduced even the toughest men to agonize
 screaming and they would be there all day i would almost be glad to get out of camp in the mornings just to avoid hearing their cries of
 unbridled pain it was a way of torturing all of us often when return from a day on the railway the men would no longer be there nobody
 asked where they evanished to i certainly did not want to know after such a horrific ordeal at the end of a japanese bayonet would have
 been welcomed so as time went on eventually no when they showed up thet there their pants their shirt their boots their socks and as time
 went on they pulled out stuff to scottite the jungle as they worked and of venally fell apart and one of the worst things to lose is the
 last thing that a star lost was his boots now and bear feet i had a new challenge my feet works streamest from living constantly in the
 wet boots and the ground was particularly unforgiving the jagged volcanic rocks often hiding dispel the surface of topsoil i knew that the
 souls would harden up but until then i went out to walk like a cripple when he using the spade i went be able to use my foot to dig deeper
 into the soil what have and would require more upper body strength having no boots also may be ever frequent trips to the banos though the
 trees even more unsavoury they were revolting vast open pits later covered in after weaken prisoners began to collapse into them and grown
 as you approached the benas you had to wait through the mud lay it with excrement of those discoursers who never quite made it flies and
 maggots and flies and maggots sworn and wriggled over this foul mash it got so bad that we had a bucket of water at the entrance to wash
 our hut to wash our feet in it all added to the misery it amazing what we take for granted as i e to the the left and he goes on to talk
 about and if if you they had you do with this when you're going through it and right in moments avidity i would often think back to my
 childhood and remember going barefoot during the long hot summers we spent down at the aberdeen aberdeenshire fisher fishing village of
 new nail where i was born so lariano having to go barefoot as feet practically falling off and the best i he can do is trying think of the
 good times in his life when he was forced to go barefoot i you think beattie some level of comradery would be critical and this is one of
 those books were again in almost every military book you to hear about beatership and come oderan there's points in his book where that
 stuff fails fails and this is where he can atal about that back to the book i even cast a gated myself forgetting involved for the other
 prisoners problems once you got started with sentimentality and grief uragano it was a selfish tactic but i was desperate to survive i was
 refusing to let the japanese wind that is like on the death march some men found the going easier by teaming up and making a close bond
 with another prisoner they would fight railway life together sharing one ever food they had helping each other wherever they could and
 always having their back maybe to beating together to share the blows in the pain it was not the way for me i watched the heartache of men
 losing their best powls and suddenly being left alone they never leave they never usually lasted very long and soon followed their mates
 to the grave by now the cuts on my feet and legs had turned into painful and dangerous tropical alters when i suffered scrape on the
 railway or had a rash i could not tend to it until yessuki which is like rest tier additive warn't till i was back at camp then i wrapped
 leaves round the contest night to keep the flies off but it was useless and the old were usually spread they rowed your flesh muscle and
 tendence people were left with deeping holes as the flesh only fell away and also would eat deep into your flesh so deep you could
 sometimes see the white of bone even worse if you are not careful they could become gangrenes and many men at last legs that way by
 improvised amputation without anesthetics or drugs i went to the medical hot for vice in common with most of the men tropical as or
 heading bolt my feet ankles and lower camps i ad a voted the medical hot until that point it was said aside from the sleeping huts and
 about the same size as ours the officer in charge was doctor makes matheson a likeable character from pately just outside gozo where he
 studied medicine he had come to sing a poor about the same time as me and with mather in much different circumstances saved my life on
 this my first encounter with him he would at least save my legs smoke under the cloud of black flies the circle outside the hut like a
 swarm of miniature vultures i entered nervously the overpowering distance we had me gasping stepping across the cadaverous forms of five
 or six men who appeared to be wrapping it dettor doctor matheson introduced himself the inot spoken for so many days that when i went to a
 plain my parched throat failed me here he said handing me a half cocoanut cup of water dip this down you i shall hippecat down and sank
 him asking how his patience were doctor matheson in his mid thirties at this point appeared to weary beyond his years he he was probably
 on self imposed to half rations just a keep so spare for his patience the man it spoke highly of him and made of our dog doctors werever
 as saint refigure the doctor took me by the arm and led me down to the far end of the hut away from the men in a soft west coast accent he
 said half of these men will die within days the other half who knows if i had access to some proper clinical treatments drugs or
 instruments they might live but that is not possible as a sure you know i can only nodding the squalors sendeth inside the hut was
 appalling nocano do for them i asked quite simply not a lot i try and give them some hope if nothing else he went on it's easy for these
 men to give up and when they lose hope the fight dismes to see right out of them on countless occasions i have seen two men with the same
 symptoms and the same physical state and one will die and one will make it i can only put that down to sheer will power we do talk about
 will power i don't think we've ever discussed will power at this level and that is what you have do men with the same siftem's in the same
physical state and one dies to one lives and the doctors only to termination as he thinks it comes down to sheer will power the will
 strong is a strong force i considered this for a moment and looked around the hut you could tell the men who were dying by the look on her
 face there game was lost before it reached their eyes and no amount of positive attitude care for doctor matthewson couching their destiny
 it certainly was not the medical staff fault there hands were tied no blood was firmly on our captors hands i turned myself right then and
 there that i would not stop fighting what can you do for this i asked the doctor lifting a foot on to a banochar tropicalized tropical
 ulcers a disease of thumbed through and fliction do you know what maggots look like maggots i asked frantically inspecting my foot praying
 that i was subject to some sikoke yes maggots tell pictou right up go down to the latrines find yourself a handful of those leave white
 beast even set them on your old sirs they will camp through the dead flesh before you know it you'll be right as rain almost as an after
 thought he added remembered account how many put on carefully you don't want to forget one and leaving it there to eat itself to death i
 left the medical hout shaking my head still wondering if i were being had letting maggot eat my sustained not send particularly appetizing
 but i was willing to willing to try anything i knew i had to stop the rot that was devouring my legs but the trees were nothing more than
 holes in the ground but now with an bulat across them a bunch of jungle leaves usually laid piled near or you took your own folly age or
 to at paper if there was no river water collected for the job at hand i have to go far to find what i was looking for i gingerly scooped
 up a handful of maggots of watching them scorn and wriggle without thinking about it too much i found a quiet spot near by and sat down
 placing just to three hundred nasty all soon by ankle the maggots which were about a carder of an instan instinctively knew it to do they
 started knowing the way it might scan in the most with the most mineself bite the sensation was of tingling unearthly yet not altogether
 unpleasant until the realisation of the maggots were eating your rawfles kinraid back to the forefront of your mind i can still feel that
 sensation to this day but the doctor matheson credit it certainly worked with in dazed the wounds and started to heal and new skin grew
 back it was a trick that i persisted with throughout my time on the railway passing enone other men when i thought i could the file that
 to day by the way the magadthi the hwyfar of it that's crazy how you with kinelike god i you know i kept all never forget that feeling of
 the magus but he he talked about it as not being totally unpleasant canalise it polly could be new it was kind of healing on me now yes i
 don't call but have you been a time ye saw we gain to guy that ah i tried to escape was captured i was unaware that any one in escape
 until one morning a sorry looking chap was dragged up before us he had been orifice beaten his swollen a bloets bertrande unrecognizable
 the intill this man very bad he tried to escape no good to guards through down on the ground in front of us the battle wreck of a human
 frame and made him kneel he did not plead for mercy or beg for assistance he knew his fate and waited sightly resigned to it the black
 prince who seemed to have dressed up especially for the occasion strode forward and oneths long sam risor he prodded the prisoner in the
 back forcing him to straighten up then the black prince raised his sword its stantial glinted in the sunshine it was a moment of such
 horror that i could scarcely believe that was really happening i closed my eyes tightly this was one of the many instances of tarbes on
 the railway that i would try to shut out of my mind but i could not escape the chilling swartsel the blade as it cut through the damp
 tropical air where the sickening swack of the sword coming down on our comrades neck followed by the dull frump of his head landing on the
 ground i kept my eyes firmly shut but swayed on my feet and felt the collective gasp of impotent anger and revulsion and not lie right
 there is something that when i heard it when i read it i kind of thought to myself that this is what separates every experience i'm added
 my life with this and that is this this gas of impotent anger and revulsion so the angers there the revolens there by its impotent and
 can't do eighty thing about it because you are a slave in your at the mercy of another human being your freedom has been taken away that i
 talked about freedom fairly often and i don't think there could be any greater reminder of how precious freedom is then reading about a
 one about a group of men that i had there fleetingly taken from them now at this point in the book and i wanted a point this out because
 if you had to see in the movie that ridgeon the river qui he may some kind spells out the differences the building of the bridge of the
 river quiet are a terrible toll on us and the depiction of our sufferings in the film of the same name was in very very sanitized version
 of the events on like the well fed extras in the movie we did not whistle colonel beget nor did we work alongside americans nor do we have
 any semblance of a uniform we were naked barefoot slaves and there were certainly no pretty and scantly clad local girls of wandering
 through the jungle and contrary the film are we alive commander colonel philip toy did not collaborate with the japanese ill i was not
 alone in doing as little work as possible without blatantly shirking which resulted in sadistic beatings energy every ounce of it had to
 be conserved for survival to music got on starvation rations was absolute suicide we had long lost our dignity and working faster
 certainly would not have brought it back in fact it would have resulted in us in the opposite with even more of us dying instead we made
 constant attempts to sabotage men whispered orders to impair the construction of the bridge wherever possible some charged with making up
 concrete mixtures deliberately added too much sand or not enough which would later have disasters effects we collected a huge numbers of
 termites and white ants and deposited a gross and joints of low bearing charms out of sight of guards i i saw it half way through wooden
 bolt as whenever possible hoping they would snap whenever any serious weight like a train was placed upon them but the river quay and its
 tributaries harboured a killer even more leader the japanese and our starvation diet as the nevile consequence of the lack of sanitation
 and the tens of thousands of bodies buried in shallow graves are dumped along in the jungle the river system was loaded with cholera
 bacteria and the monsoon season became coercion as the heightened waters of the quay of the qui flushed vibrio carry cornelia throughout
 the land this fearful disease cast a black shadow over the camp collar arrived unseen and unheard but soon had us in its grip i was slow
 to her about it but i sent something terrible within the camp more men were falling ill than usual and the japanese kept their distance
 leaving us alone they were scared to death of catching collar of themselves so as wretched disease comes into camp and you just don't
 think things can get worse and they do and you think that alice stores get on for it clara but he doesn't overnight colors drunk me down i
 woke up with explosive dire and violent projectile womaning my ears were ringing as i felt dizzy grant started in my bowels and soon
 spread all over my body as it rapidly dehydrated i was drawing from the inside out he revelling like a picked grade left out mitson the
 collar of bacteria be into the walls of my small intestine producing talks in that sucked my vital salt and every ounce of water out of my
 body i was unsure what was wrong but i knew to be but i knew it was serious i did not want to finish up with life dreamed out of the me
 i'd always been extremely careful to drink only boiled water so at first i was doubtful that it was calera i did not know much about it
 but i knew that the first twenty four hours were crucial if you see through a day in the night you would probably survive most men who
 succumbed did so in the first few hours a horrible death and to so quick men who through the bodies of color of victims on to the fut
 funeral pyres in the morning could easily contract the disease die and be thrown on the fire themselves that evening they died in agony
 like crazed animals and it was dreadful to see i lay in my bed unable to rise for work party by that i was semi conscious and i thought it
 was the end i was a locating vivid red flashes storm my eyelids i knew i had to seek help after psyching myself up on i managed to rise
 and wabble to do doctor matheson's hut as soon as i walked in he do that i had calera it was a death sentence and he was reluctant to tell
 me instead he looked at me and simply said you'll have to be elated you'll be looked after his order he's led me to a cream colored tent
 like the ones we had used in the scouts as they peeled back be tense front flap a deathly sistently doubt unknown to me this was the death
 tent and i was the unlucky thirteen occupant of a dimly lit space and already full of men when i saw their state their eyes rolling back
 rasping unintelligible voices their legs raised with knees bent the bazar telltale side of a coloratura i knew that my number was up the
 orderlies were petting me here to die but the fight was fading from me and i lay down on the canvas floor with a sense of complete and
 utter desolation but he did survive out of the thirteen men that went to the tent he was the only survivor now at this point in the book
 and i want you to remember the visit no book this is another human being is life and at this point in our tears life he actually got moved
 to a nother facility another prison camp that was for people that were really bad bad shape and he was there he went through some the
 recovery time and that's a very important part of the book and then he begins working on the docks you know unloading food to doors for
 the japanese soldiers and loading them and eventually it comes time for him to be moved and so they move the prisners of warm by ship in
 that on four september nineteen forty four nine hundred british fidus were rushed up the gangway of the kotabuki marotte thousand ton
 cargo vessel that had been named for that aenae the president harrison before i was captured from the americans using sustineamus droves
 like cattle aboard the ship and down into the holes we could never move fast enough for them the liner had two holds both quite obviously
 not made to comedy human beings yet they wanted around four hundred and fifty of us in each the lads below were shouting begging and
 pleading for the japanese not to let any more men but the louder they shouted the more frenzy the guards became down and down we went into
 the depths of hell nothing in all of our suffering and prepared me for anything like this and even to day i can scarcely find the words to
 describe the horrors of the cathegorie time i got down to the hold i had nowhere to sit i was standing rooney most of us packed in like
 star sardines with no toilet facilities most had disentrigulated bury and all manners of tropical diseases once inside and the whole
 crammed full the japanese battened down the hatches plunging us into a terrifying black pit at that moment the most fearful clamour went
 up as claustrophobia and panic lip the men many feared they were doomed and began screaming and shouting yet a strange tranquillity came
 over me i felt resigned and just thought this is it i thought that we would never get out alive i would never see home again you felt
 resigned to accept this as your last i could only think that they were taking us out this sea to sink the ship and drown us all our
 capital capable of it i seen what they were capable of anything we do nothing about these ships which would become infamous in the annals
 of the second world war has story as a hell ship a fleet of dozens of rusting holes used to shuttle supplies and prisoners around japans
 far eastern empire some of the most appalling episodes of the war turned on these ships in which men driven crazy by thirst killed fellow
 prisoners to drink their blood in some cases prisoners trying to escape from the seething mass of a sterical captives were shot by
 japanese soldiers some voyages took weeks with only a handful of prizer surviving men drank their own urine sick prisoners were trampled
 to death or suffocated the same murdered the insane and wondered when it would be their turn to go mad cannibalism as well as vampirism
 was not unknown and even japanese made were shocked by what they found when the whole were find the opened in the case of the arikaree
 where insane prisoners killed fellow man for their blood only two hundred and seventy one men survived out of one thousand six hundred and
 nineteen so all those sides aething of horologies and they don't seem realistic and you don't think it could ever happen it has happened
 there must have been at least one officer a war off seruant major somewhere in the whole but they certainly didn't make themselves known
 discipline had gone every one whatever their rank was in the same situation all of us just wanted to survive and were prepared to do
 anything to ensure that happened it would have taken a very brave man to try and take command of the men in the whole to these conditions
 it would have been suicidal it again that's one of those points where you know every book we've talked about no matter how bad things yet
 there is a leader ready to step up then you wonder if there's a line that you could ever go cross where that doesn't happen well or is i
 thought i never thought anything could ever match that terror of the railway being in the whole was worse at least slaving on the railway
 you could move and you had fresh air then another dread thought struck me summaries the catchy douar had no red cross markings painted on
 it i would later learn that some that none of the hellship bore any indication that pedestre on board as they were required to do by
 geneva convention red crosses were however painted on japanese ammunition carriers my fears that without markings we were a target for own
 side so he starts thinking well um where part of the japanese fleet now what if we get attacked by our own people what if we get sunk and
 as you can probably foresee because this story is just a misery upon misery it happens in the whole to the cacadore betterment went on the
 noise was constant in defining and awful coconina of throbbing engines moaning coughing and occasional panic stricken screaming the
 background of music for this latest torture the chilling screams of the mad and insane would stop abruptly i don't know how they were
 dealt with but i could imagine i was completely stuck where i was in the hole and could not move no one could you couldn't sit or lie down
 you could even go down to your haunches there were so little room you didn't really want to lie down any way it was a sea of human waste
 and you rest being trampled you had your space and protected it with your life i wait literally you stay strong protecting their space
 with elbows and fists by any means necessary by this stage it was every man for himself each person had their own problems to resolve
 their own life to save fagin we have not seen this yet every man for himself yes the smell and side the whole was indescribable or a
 pugnastic and overpowering mixture of extreme erin valet sweaty bodies weeping all curs and rotting flesh cloates phere there was no way
 we could get any fresh air even when the japanese opened the hatches it really didn't help that much you were still breathing in what was
 already there thirst became our biggest problem people don't understand what we first truly is you start to honte and see mirages and that
 is the most dangerous thing people died down in a hole from suffocation or heartaches the men who died were not taken away their bodies
 lay among us so one of the other vessels that there out with it take with a torpedo merican torpedo at another vessel a holding prisoners
 of war it is the one thousand three hundred and seventeen were killed or so one thousand three hundred seventeen prisoners ran bored none
 of them were killed by the explosion but one thousand one under fifty nine of them drowned or died of exposure in my you these were all
 guys that had served on the death railway guide that had already suffered just on imaginable dorture and then as he suspected they became
 their turn for minutes later we suddenly felt a tremendous blast and an explosion tore through the whole the whole structure shuddered and
 water fluttered in it from above i knew then as the water crashed on top of me that my worst fears had been realized we have been hit and
 i knew that the torpedo had struck very close to us it was in fact the first of two torpedoes that would send the hellship to the bottom
 within fifteen minutes the ship tilted we were going down so the ship sinks now the japanese had immediately treat to get off with life
 boats at left all the prisoners trying to just create rats with one ever they could even after the sinking the killing went on for those
 of us who survived and go to rafts anyone starting to panic was thrown off into the sea when they scrambled to get back they were kicked
 away men pushed under an hell the japanese men pushed under and held under japanese survivors fighting broke out as the animal instinct to
 survive a servant itself made him some survivors try to capture more seaware and shove others of tother deaths many gave up already so
 weak dangerously dehydrated and ill many goldseam and quickly went stark raving mad drowning themselves to end the torment able as it may
 sound as men became mad they had to be shoved off of the rafts or boats or the remainder might have perished perished there was a lot of
 shouting and screaming cries of get off you master or i'll kill you made me close my eyes and distress most of the shouts weren't english
 there were not many japanese the majority of whom had got off early in the life both drowning and dying men called for their wives their
 children or mothers men said fingers like daddy will be home soon and then disappeared beneath the waves it was harrowing to hear by that
 stage most of us were treading a very fine line between sanity and madness it didn't take much to put people over the top i could see
 where is coming from but a group of men started singing first to keep their spirits up they sang rule bretana after the celeritude we had
 been banned from singing this stirring at them with its line about britain never ever being slaves to their estarse some spirit as they
 start singing rule britannia a celarent was when some prisoners of just just when a japanese taking over and sing a foriner me if i now
 remember this correctly but a couple of guys or tried to escape and they got caught and basically with a stand off between the the
 soldiers and the japanese prisoners or japanese present camp commanders and they wouldn't end the soldiers did not back down until they
 had accentuated for of the four prosers that had tried to escape and the nate kept everyone else locked in the ah compound for five days
 and when the guy started to die from starvation and disentrained they based okay wolf man they signed a paper to a noontide but they they
 held the line as long as they possibly could two hundred and forty four of my comrades on the catch of bikari died that night he was
 tragic beyond the leaf that having survived the death railway they became prisoners of the deep one thousand four hundred and three allied
 service then it died as a result of the failure of the japanese to observe the genevieve tion and apply red crosses to our hellship he
 ends up getting weak after by the japanese after the avidities he does survive he gets recapture by the japanese eventually he's close to
 wear at nagasaki is but fall enough away that he doesn't die from the blast of nagasaki the war ends they get picked up and eventually
 there obviously brought home by americans and that venally said back to england he says that when he left aberdeen head weighed a healthy
 hundredth rty five pounds but here in nagasaki on the steelyard scales very ac accurate contractions similar to those i had used at the
 plumerian i was refused reduced to a skeletal eighty two pounds and gasometers of these guides of the day they literally look like
 skeletons it's it's it's unbelievable that they were even able to survive neives men from the vast industrial glad the japanese had
 created in fun flooded the quay side and length in the cue for showers so that basically clean in these guys up now getting ready to
 promachi and ship of back to america sadly at this final hole some did not make it and died on that quay this distressed the americans
 immensely and they were shocked by the matter fact way that the other prisoners excepted the deaths of their mates we had seen so much too
 much now i think quite possibly though this is the have you a book that we've talked about on the pot cast ye ordered and it's one of
 those things where it's a question if people are even gunnoono listen to this and i understand that i understand that some people did not
 make it through this reading in some people listen to it some people are going to buy this book which they should that some people are
 going to take this as a message from somebody who is seen evil in a way that not too many people can claim to it seen in a person that is
 had there every freedom taken from them and there are lives and their destiny put into the hands of sadistic people now if you did make it
 this far i will let this end on a on n incompatibly incredibly positive note and message from the author and he says that my time is a
 prisoner of the japanese helped shape and determine my pass in life just as much as my childhood did like it or not the horrors did happen
 to me and to thousands of others yet some good has come out of it my ordeal has made me a much more patient caring person inspired by the
 devotion of our hard pressed medic on the death railway i was able to care for my young daughter when she was ill and for my late wife who
 acquired twenty four hour attention in the last stages of her life while in japan and working with my friend doctor matheson i vowed to
 spend the rest of my life helping others and i am so pleased to say that i have done so it is where my satisfaction comes from now a days
 i have tried to use my experiences in a positive fashion and of adopted a mode from them which i never tire of telling others there is no
 such word as camp i have not allowed my life to be blighted by bitterness and nighters of age i've lived a long life and continued a livid
 to the fullest i enjoyed a long marriage to my wife and i have been fortunate to have a family and to join their success i have amazed my
 doctors my friends my family and myself by remaining fit i am grateful for my present way of life after all the turmoil that life is
 thrown at me and thankful to have retained my sense of humour most importantly i now visit schools to tell pupils to what really happened
 in the far eastern those torterin war years in my ninety first year i am fortunate enough despite the best efforts of the japanese and
 perilental the vim and vigor required to tell a new generation of how we suffered scandalously or sufferings which have haunted all of us
 far despisers of war throughout our lives were only recognized by the british government in the year two thousand when it offered
 compensation of ten thousand pounds to remaining survivors unbelievably the british tax peter had the pain out that poultry some and not
 the culpable japanese government i hope this book will stand as an indictment of the criminal regime that ran japan during the war years
 and the failure of successive japanese governments to face up to their crimes but i hope too that it will be inspirational and offer hope
 to those who suffer it first of the other daily lives especially in these difficult times life is worth living and no matter what it
 throws at you is important to keep your eyes on the prize of that happiness will come even when the death rail waved us to little more
 than in animals humanity in the shape of our saint we medical officers triumphed over barbarism remember while it seemed while it always
 seemed darkness before the dawn perseverance pays off and the good times will return may health and happiness be yours alice der erhart
 july two thousand nine life is worth living he hethe book is the forgotten highlander it is a phenomenal read it is a reality check it is
 incredibly moving and i i recommend you buy it you read it and you understand what the world is you get a better understanding of what the
 world is about and i know i guess i got a better understanding on what the world is about in reading this there pretty much every detail
 like every every little element that he went through made me think like thing i'd rather i'd probly rather die in that situation in every
 little thing and happened to and there is a nurse obviously thousands of thousands and thousands of men that made that choice yet and
 there will got broken and they just they lost the will to live so it's a credible house strong that human will is that you can survive
 that he to pounds this entrecote also in your legs put in maggots on your legs you know i mean it's just an it's truly incredible what
 that what the human can survive and it's also true incredible with the human can complain about in this day and age right i mean an can
 compare about just the most ridiculous things yer just the most ridiculous things yea the scatebat spectre miss yet disrobing me to never
 complain about anything ever again you know what i mean in you don't do let me complain about anything ever again an consider myself a big
 complainer but come on this is just we have no reason to complain about anything be yet men let's crazy to is one of one of the heavier
 parts there where i felt it was when he talked about the clustered yea know you have an issue in it it's there by is not netson too
 presentative to it but it's something i know i feel that that that's like a tough one to get over you know the tantisper ll going through
 all that stuff first and that you no death a clot on don't know man i might be to have for me well was too avitor a lot of people and ye i
 mean it's almost like ye yowe almost don't need to have a discussion about this book the magnetist stopped talking about it every one go
 read it i get it now and just less move on you know as the cause yotlik like i said it is makes you realize just use what kind of
 suffering there can be and how good you've goed how good you've got it i want to go to bed night in my bed nasone good youthinasia that my
 preciated every night ye yes to cause you think about like some little things you don't even think about but they're like a real luxury it
 it's just things that you really enjoy which i don't even think about it entusiasmo me i really like a nice cold you don't beg of bottle
 awater you know i have a big just a big bottle water i completely take it for grantei go to work it genatum of hiccups and fair filius old
 mice intereat not i oh i don't think anything about that you do that would be like heaven even and that he at deconocio bed at night you

 climbing to those you don't think about that you're not thankful for that every night yes but pretty much everything like a yorite thing
 pretty much everything even like a theniorita ran now ye like it consider that compared to that what you jesrad there just was just
 bringing a astarita let us break it down with air yea yea yea the the beginning i remember em the cable gay was coming waarom silly i know
 and am and he was late usbec at miss he was the cut off right where i was going to call you like you know before it stronger there will go
 repates leonato fifteen or something and i to go i want to see good to work out or something this is getting worse and worse i know that
 the noteable points get a hot the afford mieyeninu like but all night long on us you know he he's fixing not fixing me for under no i am
 brandenstein yes and yes that that's one of the things i thought of primarily when you said think of all the little luxury to not only in
 not only in my complaining in about something i don't need i'ominie about something that i'm kid like a subsistere luxury i'm complaining
 about that you know because it didn't come a fifteen minutes of all things umber the time that it did yes i gontchareff to god idea i
 meecher myself too so which that lets a what's got to some question from the internet and actually to start this one of em after the last
 pot cast number eleven when i had lay fawn and we talked about mark it duckboard lee we talked about rindoe and talked about chris kyle
 and ill we actually didn't talk about mighty months or so i had a couple of people ask me he why do you ask talk about my hemanta while
 the the the simple reason is he's kind of similar the reason why i hadn't talked about marked right and chris yet either until i got lay
 fan because lay for the the charm patooan er those guys were in charlie paton and i wanted to have him on as a you know as as a i don't
 know what the word i'm looking for it but i wanted to have a guide from his baton on or from there paton on to talk about him and i just
 that's the way i felt and so that's what i stop with with mike mike was dealt up to and i i can promise you i will be talking about mike
 at some point on this mike you was just for nominal anded hero and a saint and how i actually absolutely be covering his life and how he
 died and how we remembered him then how we remember him still but i i really just want to get you know somebody from his paton that was
 you know right with him ah the whole time and necessities the asheous it so that's one of an o do and yet susie my key so it was mike will
 make will definitely we don't will have a show for my habsolutely mike deserves that held shone a and we laid for my so be ready for that
 i don't know whom we get water his lot a godsend to her to on active duty ah the portinari on active duty the ah all his good friends are
 still on active duty so it's going to be tough it's goin t be tougher and might take a little bit of time but that's the plan then it'll
 be worth it so let's go to the next question jocko regarding mistakes what are some of your own and some you seem made by leaders you
 looked up to and otter recover can some one ever fully regained trust is as actually for easy one because umlaou make mistake on it ah the
 the worst thing you can do if you make mistake is trying to void takbar it that's the worst thing you can do and if you think about the
 bosses that you've had that you had some boss of made mistake and he's like dewanny fault eudestet for him so you can't do that you got to
 take you out to take ownership of it um he gives any again if you did not the postaya and the times that you had a boss that made excuses
 you don't have any mercy on them you just ruthful son them you just pick up a part and if so that's step number one is um you don't take
 ownership if you make a mistake and that's how it's always seemed to me for a illok up the chinaman you know if i saw a bit at me and
 mistakes and he took on a ovalifolium you know he knows he intimate will support him if they're doing the other thing in their blame
 erybody else and not taking ershi you're goin have hard time with it and as a matter of fact i actually at a metenin of my patons where
 this is a long time ago i it's you know all the names or long since forgotten but we had a we had a a mutely and appleton where we said
 you know pretty much as ustorio gus we had a we went to the we literally went to the commanding officer and so we don't redisguise so you
 all these ideas that people have of the you know military and of you know we obey orders now eurotic o what a little jack as i was we you
 know we say all you know an we don't warriga were to go to the commanding officer and tell him we don't want to work for this guy then
 creating all set to his full credit he was like lesage's you can't have a beauty not of my command not at my team you get sucking he
 figured out a way to work it out go do your told get in line aloft moutonne didn't work and then he fired the cat yes and all he he liked
 basically made a perfectly clear like this is your one chance and a fire then medalist was it was pretty crazy to see this he happened but
 and i say this on titi wasn't because the guy lack tackle scale was the cause he was a tical fit it most to the fortinas because he just
 cold take any one you know if i he wouldn't listen anybody and so when he was making a stake it was with no no it oaths way no okay
 constant cover up for himself he and obviously it it didn't work out for to your meeting he sort of sput him on put him on notice thou's
 right up assentially yeah but i finalement ng officer i think was really just doing the right thing saying looked is you can't have a
 muiden work that way to is the military get back in there dot your supposed to do and then he was like okay i ganapati guy anteneasmus not
 be good to have every inlisted guy in the patonce forward and say i don't want to work with his guy ye that's not a good sign ullagoning
 job and he was actually a great great cleaning off sir to let an at work on the deal kindhered on the deal was echoed say and then i
 actually the guide took over was one of the best guys i ever worked for if not be best and yet i was pretty awesome um inditas far as
 regaining trust which is the unformation this old host issued as you had met that you made a mistake you are automatically regaining trust
 that's where you start again in trustees goes from there that you follow through with what you say you know your case they trying to build
 drust in relationship that's what you're trying to do in the mining or blind to people how you building trust right and if you make a
 mistake and you say it's by your fault then that's a lie and every one knows it ye that that fear is um especially not necessity but in
 regard segregating trusts of speak um in one one it its mistakes they have that fear that all their gannath i don't know what i'm doing
 the aradna a handle on this you know so doesn't matter it's you know doesn't matter it's so much better to go haggies arigato do this can
 you show hototogisu never done this before he or he never i'm never uses goteborg can you give me an indoor this thing and right the worst
 thing you can do is stepping with a weapon you've never used before not now otowaka loadeder an safe in and look like a tilted and give
 any lovelike a guide is too arrogant and two insecure to ask ye esactly it's actually a sign of insecurity of you can't ask when you need
 some help on something yenissey one peleidean in a position and how can justicing nera being to no is like you you come off way more
 transparent than you think you know people will like i don't know something just as small as i name dropping named job someone righteous
 mention this person named but you really name dropping eidin small way ye i people can smell that easover like this stuff stuff that's a
 little bit more important where if a leader in secure about some day want to make like anotheh but he really disforested like that i know
 but a ityania an i do stuff like that idea of god as did undeliberating everyone everyone knows it and a lot of people brother not in
 touch with that they think that all ianthy don't know because i'm just consort of mention it in this all these little things that if
 sintoist reek of the notion o put it like that i want i'll just say like i said you waymore than you think ye you and transparent is this
 day at age actually has a positive committin of a few know that sea but people view always really transparent guy you read you really just
 tell you what's going on if you're deliberately traversing it in a negative way sonlike can see right through you exactly as the s yeh yeh
 when you're not trenorirolcio difference there anatoly true but it is definitely better just to you don't ask inside i don't know that in
 security to the when you don't feel like asking something that's all knocking at noon that lorinser at your insecure what you an eleonore
 kanus i am stuck on this problem are kekyo give me help but as cause i'm oneone don't say all this case it almost you're doing it every
 three sentences or i have no you haven't studied a cause you got to study got a new your tree can really or assif you don't you got alert
 it oh you got break out the bullocks you know it but when you broke out the books and now there's a little bit of stuff that you still
 onderstand we guess what tis as the question ye because your pontlieue knew they should no word now ye you know this is highly likely that
 ernemont i mean i was a radio man for eight years in the supes by the time i was let lieutenant commander in a true i didn't know as much
 as those you know guy's knew about all the new radio ostasiens question is no big deal ye if you are secure in your leadership here you
 find ask a couple of questions it not that big of a dealer but you are not clear and i the people you're not clear to make excuses and
 that's what that's how you levanters is by telleth is really a simple concept you know next question in regard to working out right and
 training for a sin selection and by selection you mean i mean special forces or ranger or see a selection year execration he so jack what
 do you think of rocking as fitness verses just train up so for pepole that don't know what rocking is rocking as putting a back back on a
 rock sack with a bunch of weight in it and walking along distances and to be honest with you really are jogging you know you really going
 at a pretty good pace when you're doing it and that it is hers erupting to attaint in you be cates in the military m taken bring the pain
 with rock at marches forced road marches as what they called the the reckon all o benloyde racking to he don't want to be rocked in a
 indians you know you'll do twenty miles for road march which is just your armored with a fifty pound pack just marching yes and ah so the
 thing is like anything else if you want to get good at it yet i do it right so if you want to get good i be as melanocephala fetors how do
 you get it running run how do you it swing so oh you are not to get good as you gito did you get to a now get on the matinee bunch of ah
 an you want to get good rocking at humpin a rock a carrying weight over long distances rock he cause is all kinds of little things got
 used to her feet attingit prepared and you're gonna get weird mussels your back's got to get stronger you can get you know causes all over
 your feet it takes us special type of fitness regiment to get used to and ready for a long rock marches and especial fitness regiment is
 rocking de and lots of it so ah if you want to eventually you can admit that you know you could start doin squads you can start to
 espronceda ll help you you know as fine but the fallentin of the preparation for rock humping should be rock humping and that's what's
 going to make you good at it so did you do that i did i did and rocking for me actually oddly enough is something that i was at was good
 at no and its weird because i wasn't the fast is springer then i wasn't the best long distance runner which but that maranathema what i's
 fraid and you can't run on disastrous what's wrong with you you can in the middle that i will end the middle incur in on and what i
 realized was that was good for carried a rucksack and i got used to it too because i was radamanthus had her i was at to carry a freaking
 radio you know a thirty pound radio with the water batteries in years it's always happy you decocted up it's only i got used to it i
 suppose it was that more than anything else you like um your fine move termers no i am they'd been e travailla there that time at the end
 they are like man we need to we need to go to those mountains for those you know to avoid the underground worms and they were like a week
 o take the cat and he was like he it's it's slow at all a cat is the big in the but bob cat you know i actually know what a bobcat is i'm
 not sure i know what under ground a worn were artemas one thing completely different but they're bad so they took the cataneo's like now
 we antiphates than all mewlike it doesn't mithionary a ton oiou know it was used like you you're like the cats so they hooked up this big
 trailer which is the rock in your jeany know and they and they drove everybody um you know to the mountain where we deplaned you walk no
 they're trapped on unboton a roof top and there are like robin a star but pier we got to make it to the mountain is like nine miles
 carlyle goin to get there we can't you know we can't run they got to get us we can't you know so it is a will get to cat got there like at
 too slow but there takinaka carry with this big trailer yes you know and i ushshami i my opinion was it was better to be built like a four
 by four and like a poor ye mean was better to be a just cattegara wait around a right or you durable ye what would you rather have
 workington the farm a ford f three fifty or a port eimenos cool for the track when everything's all lined out and dialed the way it's
 billetita kind of train going on you won't that for before and he wanted badenites why you don't know the sea with these guys that were
 kind of more a four by four and then a poor yes he would lead an er in the field in the real seal situation yet in other rateau because
 the the thing about that's that's it's a man a misconception about the seal teams is you know you see guys running on the beach many see
 that swimming in the ocean and they never a carrying anything yeats is complete lie musing every time you do anything in this he will
 teams your caring at tanai with you ye and so you got to be built like a four by foreign alike a poor year ye makes sense though yet you
 way rather some one like you than some sprinter who can run like a fortuity but then you put some you know something on his efforts
 actually you know what you you just want somebody that's durable yea durable is the word yeah an fer great athlete and hacendado awesome
 forty time or they can run a marathon but their just durable it's also yeah okay i'm not trying to milk for admirers around the guys sure
 gethers guise there was a guy with i was a team too and he is a guy actually went through buds with and he was he is he is kunashir guy
 and he was kind of had a odd body shape and so we kind o looked he got out almost like a little pudgy belly and a ideas one of those guys
 and the funny thing is he could run faster menehould bent more than me he had no getting nose asimulate is also gie asika i said you know
 that's cool people say that about him because he's a little bit short he would have but bawdyken i'm like he can he can actually bench
 more than me and he can run fast you can be in all rio well let's just be quiet i i next russian japan do you think that the military army
 navy air force is a young man king gos he this this guy is twenty nine years old and he's about to join up he about to get it on man but
 also a two answers to that question and as usual with answers from me and the icosameron tely there's a dichotomy in the opposing other a
 first of all yes and anybody that says is not a young man's game is not telling the truth because i a game where you goin t be on travel
 you'd be gone to be risking your lives at times you're going to have to put up with a lack of comfort in your world you an you living a
 barrister a man is just going to be it's not it's not creature comforts right if the military is a y spartivento at not the for gout in
 highland or for the love of god but it's but it's definitely more spartan and what the average person has a regular life so to anybody to
 say it's not but young man's game is does not tell the truth because it absolutely is and for me you know i joined when i was a kid when i
 was eighteen years old and it was also i had no attachments in life by i will went to them that station with nothing but with that the
 that's the recusat on where you actually go and i very wistar but it's where you actually leave for the military man i had not i had
 nothing heralded to story thing do what your you know where you descend your man i don't get matters no male that sent to me a blank slave
 and that awesome you don't think about family you don't think about anything you just get in here you get your job dantini they say hey
 we're going to for you to morrow for the eight years you say cool will allow you as bring it day and and you have a bold bad get nature
 because you don't know any better you know you joined the military year your stole you're getting pay check all of a sudden you know you
 got a three hoteo it's all good you know whereas when you are as you know when you're seventeen years old and you're not quite putting
 things together yet a man all of a sudden like i said you got to pay check you got three ones and got you a rock and roll they tell you
 what you do you do it that's good so i do young man's game now that be in said of ours or a dichotomy of that and that is that the
 military is it always in need of guisarme and smart and havener ence in life in that you need to have people like that how you get them
 eventually through the military it but it's also good to have people that want raisin the military vibrates if he can always have a little
 bit of outview and you can learn a little bit from them but what you have to get over if all those things at the young guy can eat for
 breakfast right you know if you twenty nine years old there's a decent chance you've had a pretty nice apartment somewhere there's a
 leecence and left it until you know nine forty five on the weekends there's a decent chance that you stay out till two gloctoring and
 party and you know brother back and you slept in until nine and you might be doing that on the regular london you you've got some clothes
 you watching cable t v you all these things right and then the other the other part of as you might have a family you know you've it have
 a wife you might have kids at twenty doyers old yes you might be established you might have people relying on you not just financially but
 emotion heads to be there so how you can come all that way that's the challenge for the older died now some older dancer toninas old they
 don't have any that yet if it so that case nero you got both that i'm not telling the tear old the whole off on him on enlisting in the
 military don't roll off just get it down get it on and you won't regret it unless you are unless you screw up and bringing upon yourself
 but if you are twenty nine if you can either overcome those obstacles of the things that are going to matins that are gonna things that
 are going to care it you emotionally were right in you a territorio ly now wit's cool is when you're in the military and your raised the
 military you are raised in such a way that those those distractions are easily overcome right you are out of your not a compartment is
 things at least i did to say i know what he understand it's nice to stay home and sleep in in the weekend but i'm not going to do it for
 it cries nice to be all to hang out with your wife and kids but it doesn't matter to leave confectory job that that's what you had uplike
 we can slightly psychopathic but its wear you end up right yes where it's where i antoli's what i ended up as you know nothing else
 matters besides this you ll teams and i don't care about anything else so if you want to be my life cool you conditon these giant
 parameters that's called celticists deal with it that he so joined up maeter twenty nine years old don't get after it to that petit next
 question jack when do you cut your losses or give up on something in a walk when and how to decide to cut beat not a quitter too much
 brain damage brain damage so word i been hearing more for the corporate world actually as people talk but with something really hard to do
 and they just cause i brain an ache by trying to do it and these was actually too questionable metaphor obvious that he a yeah it's a
 encasement for for it and it's better for for i talk about what i was like a beating my head against the wall gothinians is one of those
 things that confuses people because every one hears including us in the sealer the mantra of never never quit right never quit and it's
 not just a mantra that we say it's actually it's actually what we believe is and furthermore it's not just what we say and it's not just
 what we believe but it's literally how we act it so that that drive in that attitude of never quit it's a powerful force and it does push
 you over the edge to victory to victory in many cases but anders always a dichotomy fiesta out everything there's a dicotomy to this too
 because over that attitude you have to lay erasme thing on top of that and that is this basically stricken dicision and understanding of
 the battle field as a whole so you know it's like the the the saying of when the battle lose the war and this is the opposite rewives the
 war meeting oh you you stick to a right now and you might win right now but in the wall run your goin to lose this in the opposite where
 you you're an say not a man to lose his power right now around the win the war the long run so you absolutely need to know when you got to
 stop beating your head against the law you gotta know that i firstly draw my limit at twenty seven times after a beat my head against the
 wall twenty seven times on the twenty eighth time i'm going to say you know what i enthrone way to do this on lady this is no battering
 now the main reason i think why people get caught in the trap of bangor adgans the wall or not knowing when to go it is because engin
 quinteroon work and it's almost hard for me to say right now because it's not knowing when to quit that my talk about aethereal in getting
 the alledge the andantino making in a strict assessment of the unwin of a situation and deciding to disengage only suit new can re engage
 with superior fire power and crush the enemy yet some so there's a big difference between that and quitting cording means you curl up into
 a ball and wait to die that's where would is and ah i don't support that under any circumstances so when do you when did it happen were it
 happens because people get emotional they tootin about whatever it opposable in front of them may he crazy about it and they start seeing
 the obstacle as not only the battle but also as the war and they get longsider own determination have seen this with a seal buddesby near
 so determined that the they will not stop even when it's completely detrimental iyo know and and do it would just about everything you
 know they'll be determined that eighty thing you know that be hurting themselves training they'll be you don't determine to drink are than
 anybody else no evanishing you can throw out of a net to turbine to win it that interaction losing yes um so so how do you prevent that
 from happening it is your half to all the income on them here you have you detach you after detach yourself he after you be able to step
 back away from the promenade look at it from a strategic purpoint and say okay what's what's going on here what's the wires what the
 reward how much of my willing to sacrifice right now and how is that sacrifice in a impact me come or or the next day or next week you in
 then once you've detached and you wah and seen what the real value of the dis immediate objective is then you can assassin make a logical
 decision based not on your emotion but on the actual impact of the situation in the overall strategic picture yes then am i your saying
 you wait a detriment in the in the the rewards and when i think that that really makes it real clear when you can assess and de like o all
 of this were getting all this like all these this detrimental stuff one were trying to get this you know this one right benefit renaldo
 this person or out of this situation or whatever and when you're you're using up your resources or sacrificing more resources than you are
 gaining ground then you know that that seems like a clear time to it at the very least start thingbut a disingaging yes and you got it you
 got it to cash gildonian you get one time people trying pass because garnisseuses example ye people just like do one guard pass ye and it
 doesn't work and they do togantog do to gain it doesn't work the day i think go on and on and on until they are exhausted we get mounted
 and then they get put to that insane in its ancaster were stubborn and they didn't do catch in si mean after you've tried to pass a guy's
 guard fourteen times in a road the same way as a form to wise going to work the fifteenth time the answer is it not try something else on
 otenti solid solid answered teverino as all out at tetuanites to training they get like bog down in a bad situation and they would hum
 they would they would just be striteforard on that one problem you know one room in a building they'd be like nocano guys into it said
 more guys into an ever skin sprayed with pan all and put down in the training operation and now to more eyes and eventually every one
 sister's trading but everyone's dead and there led on and on out then you just didn't i got folks on it in a costume so the leaders got to
 be able to step back and patch and take a look at the situation and desired to know what i'm goin to go had up changed course right now
 not going to quit but i'm no just make us captious yes and and that's it's weird how those semantic skin really change your outlook on the
 whole task when he's when you use the word quit verses disengaged or if another one with quit like a citation you know i give it up i mean
 less as something negative like smoking or something like that you quit smoking your geminie up some in that's good but i very smoking a
 egout any kind of task or anything that requires effort if you quit or quote unquote up it's like it's hard to have that sound like a good
 thing you know dear and one thing that's dies you know obviously it applies to combat it if i juditious we just at palanan you look at
 what you're doing day to day and the little things of your life your turn out make orrobin ess that you're trying to make something happen
 and sometimes people get to so addicted to their plane they get so their eagles wrapped around their plan their plan as like fifty per
 cent fifty per cent tactics and technique and its fifty per cent their only ego and so on you cried when that person's plan starts to fail
 that what they don't want to let it go cause it's all wrapped up in the regal so they just push it further telesforo they pursue further
 and especially if a person in cedros tion well then every one kind of just fallen in line and their look anthem they all although they all
 know when they are the bottom the change may all look in this person saying hey bunny's not working i let's disengage new and fall back
 and figure out a new plan of attack and in much we approach the target from a different angle let flank this target so if you're in a
 business if you're in a relationship relates some an you got a situation where you're trying to make something work a certain way and it's
 not maybe it's got a disengage a got come with a different angle of attack so you can get the big wind an he long run ye and with
 relationships of is it is it's the same dynamic but it's different because um what the same because when you're in a lifebringer atshop
 whatever you venison wife um you say so working in please so one of them abusive right mean while the other one's trying to quote unquote
 make it work and and if they end up leaving all you gave up on him you know me you or you you quit not an item pietaeque relationship but
 you would see you gave up on their relationship right ill well he's been abusing her for ten years already you know or in your is twenty
 seven years you know whatever the number is and i and you got to i do not abuse my wife or i ribou know as far as your numbers go but
 twenty s um but again like if you say oh you gave up on the relationship with the cunies kinda like it's the girl's fault on it like mad
 then she cheek she shouldn't a done that almost you know but am yet he disengaged and you minutio are to go for the wind in that
 relationship and if you really want to maintaindrai don't let it be husband wife relationships may be go back to being neighbours or
 something like that even though an abusin perlsucht not work but that i'm disintegratively yeah i'm not sure about all that he surat i do
 know that if you find yourself trying repeatedly to make something happen and it's not happening try different route i don't consider
 yourself a quitter consider yourself a tectosages or attacked his shoe your next question jackal in a fight i a ma or otherwise would you
 substitute anger or rage for aggression would i substitute anger or rage for a gresson's a fight and a otherwise a support actually yes a
 liseuse finances like instead of aggression is it okay us anger or rage elwell i think pretty obviously and people will expect the answer
 to be for me the initial answerers now and i would not substitute anger or rage for aggressive neces ah i think obviously when you let
 raceace over you or thinking any more tea and the mind is a legend the most important weapon and i actually believe that to be true so if
 you let your rage and anger take of you a user mind and that is not good and you actually get this heat this in amaniel regular basis
 because you'll get somebody that is really good at talking smack and they'll get in the other person's head was a man to get the other
 person's head what do i do to him does it make them sad no does it make them not hate the opponent no what does it do to him it makes him
 angry if it makes them frustrate it and that anger leads to frustration which leads to defeat so indian i think it's important i
 recognised that this doziest occur in and the man either curran every day life and a good example to when you get to conversation with
 somebody you getting to bake with somebody you get in on the argument with somebody the minute you get frustrated or angry or enraged you
 saw the argument a right i mean you might you might feel like you want a but you will not win the argument you you lost the argument in
 the man that that happens yet in any yeshonadadekenah because the alien understood your debating your canoeist each other and then as you
 just went off the rails basically right ye it's not good to lucertone in a debate in a conversation for in an memaitch like if you plan
 chet we are playing chess and i was talking back to you you got frustrated and sliptoe chess word yea you are a sad with the with the um
 you know edgily of monumental power whatever whatever the yarrayarra you as well yet you will you lost in a way ye you you absolutely used
 em so but ideal i talk about the alltime is that the rule is he'd never let your emotion getting control so you don't let anger rage
 overwhelm your little brain and now here is the here's the other side of that coin here's the dichotomy and i don't think you can even
 argue against his cause it's he that's pretty sound argument right and they went we just sat on me we seen it we know we know for a fact
 but rules are made to be broken um there are times when a motion caniengas performance i right there on solar and i remember gasiharon up
 the the soviet union was still distorted coconuts and when i would watch like the olympics they would be like machine the soviet no motion
 as of a aeration ed to be like that in often broncoes but i heard a cloak when i was a kid i actually looked for it can wanted to bring it
 up a confines something along the lines of this and that was that soviet the soviet athletes performed better and braces but the americans
 performed better in this datum hum so the americans and that not a universal statement of this plenty of examples of the russians be
 americans in whatever but there's also eatables of were the americans with their emotion and there fireweed beat these russians and
 mangrave example would be the maricle wise on ice and like positioning which is you know that was a bunch of college kids that were fired
 up and be the hardened russian professional hockey team now and in it because only kind of trained their emotions out of it and there's a
 great kind to have your motions strain out of it you know there is a great time where you like you know what i'm not gouty motions play
 into this a a or something about tigeroo and his golf game and he's not thinking about you know the the broad statement as when he is
 hitting a shot and golf he's not thinking about the last night and he's not thinking about the next shot he just think you of that shot
 right there so there's no emotional of whether his yatton or nothing ill eneis is there in that one shot so i think that you know we get
 people meet americans of example i used but i think that people in general caius your motion too to your advantage sometimes but it does
 take control and it takes direction and also i think it's important to remember that it doesn't take long for that extra fire of anger to
 go from making you stronger and faster to make you slower and weaker both meanly and physically so you could get that bursten you're
 sinfioti all time where people punch itself out you know they go arago level savitre and ester swing in for the tarminate even yet
 oranside think the guy that think the guytoun the her locker in the comely bring the thunder for they get they get emotional you know and
 i think all the man when you get a guy that loses his temper wouldn't when somebody was in the separate on the mat it's just a matter of
 time like i just got out a coles got you know he's got three beetles leashes goin to be done so ye you've got a stay came now a couple
 situations i'm seen or beneficial in a and a pretty sure i was trying to remember this for sure but i was cornering dermestes if you don't
 know german stevens is little heathen anima also guy stated fighter and we were training about the time and he was fighting it pretty sure
 it was in in mark's names whose up well respected boxer so really good in may fighter is well but definitely known for his box in well
 jeremy's known for his striking as well as a very balerful striker and he's got unbelievable one punch knock out power dermius so i was
 contingere and it was a really really close fight i'll meet it was a i do know if he was winterless think it was lead in towards markestan
 and there's three rounds in emma in this in this fight and in between the second and the third round i got in the ring got in the cage
 with jeremy and i i did befall on you know it is face and ill i know i gave him the alison this is what's going on this guy crossing from
 us taken money off your kids tablelike food off your kid tawaina take you on the roof off their heads you take in everything that you work
 for he's going to take it from you right now you got to get pistonrod him and i got you i got giafar up speech like that and you could see
 it switching in eyes he realized like he went into a rage of idikut guillotine out that round and knocked him out yander them and that's a
 an i'll tell you another one i saw that was it was the same so it was it was carlos condit verses roaring mc donald and this was an this
 was the first time they fought i put yer was again and i was there i forget who is cornering but i was there and i was done with cornerers
 cornering and i was things peter siboni was corner he was up in canada but am so carlos conduct were rowing mcdonald and carlos who's the
 veteran is going up with kinked know rodion awinkin of an a livin unknown but he was definitely the younger attesters old you are just a
 kid no offence rory but he was young you don't hate mean bad as for young and cornwallis the vat you don't even oweenee grown man with a
 wife and kids and man will rest getting the better for an front of roy's home town well i don't have his home down but it was a canada
 hansard was absolutely supporting rory least am pretty sure i remember this right of sorry if i don't but it seemed like the crowd was on
 the side of roary mc donald he so in between tones watching the fight but i had snaked a really good seat in orderly could for matey when
 i go to c thanks dan a white and the rest of the crew like ice niketas awesome sets after i get a corner yet people so thankyou so i was
 sitting you know in the second row or something to nominal see that i'd mocito and because i tell you the chief seats when you're when
 you're gone epoove out to the wants of fontenaye the nose bleed which is is a cool so i just get aggressive attack we moved a better
 petitions which is using the second row wiegand the press box sir so i'm sit down there and a watch in the fight and gregg jackson is
 cornering carlos cot it now if you don't know anything about grand jackson he is he's passed like a guy and i've actually ah go and back
 in the day going away back in the day when edair competing all the time in the kind of the sole cow seen of grappling we would we do every
 competition there was ane can beat all time grappling my room ever never there so many of them that we do and and a great jackson would
 bring eyes out to to fight to compete in a like we wrestled against these guys i know a week did observing as he astounded from that and
 then surprising me one time when the us was in san diego i was that worn at the heel poems and some one called and said haters there's a
 guy from the u s c here do want to give him a tour of you know he wants a toronto have to set up a tour of the selem they want shubrick
 the futility of her who it is you know the whenever some some guns you know just the gear whatever susanite acon and you know we kind o
 had a little bit of recognition but a anyway greg jackson and you know you kind o hear this stuff about greg jacks and all the time that
 he is this really nice guy and that he is super mellow that he's really humble well if all reenters a super disguise he super humble he's
 just a fantastic die and ah i gave a torn so we kind o got to know each other and then you know going fast forward now in the ouse i i of
 cornered him several times on one time i've quarter against him you know antinomy fighters or fighting his fineried said he's a really
 like a really mellow and eenie i if you watch me the corners of his fights he's always like that josey steady and hay this is what you
 need to do yet watch out for this or whatever some watching this fight and like i said carlos content personated carlos's not winning
 rites not winning and it between a the second in the third round gregan goes full besure i mean he is yellow at him he is in his face he
 point out of his wavin his finger he is going not on him and i was i be grajaos is bringing the heat and sure enough he and up
 calconcillos connect and finished roar in the third which is a fight he was definitely in a loose so what you see there he is the motion
 helping to win in that situation is and ah actually before the fight was over i saw greg and i discoosed something to him you know like
 they did you want for with her obinangoes me and he said i see i had to do it it is funny you could see it i wanted like he'd never done
 it before i know meanwhile have grandon at some point he can tonsoribus he said something a long while if you don't like i had to do it in
 and in it it were a teetotaler smile on and that was working it and it deftly indeed it did work yet and those would you he think i'm in
 this pool gas but do you think that's because those just have him to be the exceptions or is it because really the formula kanitseeno like
 hers the motion and then here's all the logic in the skill and the planning implementation of of you know galitsin all the all the stuff
 that you're going to use in your in your mind and here the motion it's like like a little smart blood or something in an am these ly
 motion can go up but the skill otago up proportionately and once you'd start to do this when the motion takes over that's one you know
 when you're going to fail her or you take advantage tainters sweet spot in there where for moments in time emotion and even border lining
 on rage with i think range is a little bit strong cause i think rage you lose your clarity let anger which is you can still have some
 clarity of what you're doing right so i think you can actually that can be utilized appropriately at the right times and i think these
 times you know what the dorotee you know i had to provoke some anger out of him he you know i had to provoke an absolutely helping us gone
 that fight and is a same thing with carl's calls absolutely good i lose that fight ividint do something different if he didn't you know
 it's like it's like it in the turbot it's like it up when i jesooit is not going taintable the night you saw side blower it's only got a
 get you get me so can make you go a hard for another yet not isn't another to mittel without necessities not dry long at all acteau with
 but with anger you know we can make you go for another m you know ever may be it may be it's too minute and this is something else have
 you er missed like a heavy single like like you at your letting your dad left angornou donolan or something and you miss the heavy signal
 a nineveh done no i have heard a herd o si so this is another easy way to prove it man i miss i have signals sometimes and sometimes i
 just get an gratuities to bring the anger he and i start getting fired up and i start thinking about things that make me angry you know
 and i get all that barn out ripped that thing off the floor like a hate it yes he and it absolutely makes me stronger that moment so is
 that a jest probably a dreadlessly the same thing that pampinea's or orenge man's head its front the same thing that part pumpin the
 carlos i had but it's crazy because despite punched de spiking a beaten despite having some one you know trying to destroy you in fort of
 a large crowd of people none of that was able spireas all spark tejon inasmuch as some kind of a patent the notional portion of your mind
 i bring out just enough rage to get out there and get that job done once for all yes and the end that's really the key there just enough
 for age especially when you're talking about em something that requires technique when you say lifting your your like porkenham and um i
 remember i was in in college and i was going for my one rimac and yet you feel a couple of times but for the sake of saving time and stuff
 you can avail to give you three times won't in my case the there were like forget it three times um so the first time i'd gotten all of
 them i was a pretty solid at partlins that time so's getting all of them and then i got to that point em and i didn't get it is three hunt
 three hundred i weigh one eighty five at the time a toiney eight are you looking for prompt righteous that protestations proper memory is
 talking arrebo when you name dropped and stuffiness i did no i did not on purpley treeferns if ereford it cotton my way to leave out that
 number true true you know you want it to know you wanted to know a much is doing i do you anisotoma ter for now you want it already way
 doesn't matter none the less the first time i failed and it was like no he'll cut this you've got this in and had this getting run wood
 whose name a publind hair like us like you just tough accedit reward and you you always get nuts and you like you can't is you didn't you
 all hear as this and then you make any matter whatever and i didn't outwardly express any kind of anger but i felt that anger and
 politikes technique done the thing it's not like it's just um you know like one i come to meeting bench has some to any but ever left this
 is miss er everything i seknebtunis a little bit more technique than other less you yea so it was jeff the perfect amount average you know
 nescafe a want in a person you are like every stevens he could tell just even the way he trains the hesse rag in there yet you oupos to
 the a roman for example seemingly at an don't watch him trinitarian but it seems like he's so periodical in arragon or anger whatever is
 it is a asmuch of a part and some one like dumanet with a with a problem like crazy all yes what are the borges manderton is the way they
 trained up there at ristori i spent like those to the week end alike hathaway or whatever with them with for as an am and rory and it heat
 froshets head you know that will hold me tsim sure is the hold me iseult as his head that you hit the head instead of the mid aloft seems
 like all that's not that like it seems kind of obvious i never seen the one to that and it made weymore beca'se hit midst before and then
 you when you go to sparklike it it kind of weird you go again used to the difference between a heating mit and hating so onstead saw a
 penetrant these cases chose smart up here in cataracts greedinesse all the guys at getting getting a ocean fight man it's also to watch
 and that that lawler ah mcdonald slight was just a wishes einsamkeit was in the same year that fight if you haven't any one has watched
 that fight was a fight to see ole warmers just blearing in it all and leave it at all right there and again to go with that fight ah so
 did you get the owego the part for yes yes and then when he has the thing a bottiaean isn't so you i yeah i got it right and so you go up
 as the kyoto he go up and wait the next one it was like three o three like so permalloy the doolittle had fleeting get the theatre not
 even clothes on everything was pantalette went aetat one didn't let me see where at the all time life my not i just disengaged that's all
 that will i instigated or said see where it sat youth as you like we should go on to the next kirstenin for about one more would say i
 think so ye will you jack is the ability to switch on and off a personal feature or is it a trained skill is this confused with the term
 peatsmoke what causes that switched flat the overdrive the beast moweth full on destroyer that will not stop and he gets actually missus
 it is something that's lunertick adding in a hard lesson i don't think every one get it that exam people go through life without ever
 getting it and i tell ye it's eight in the borden last nature its radicle let each thing that allows you could go the extra distance to
 dig isoline bit deeper in the pose a little harder gesterin like mediate things in life there is a dicotomy cause it actually take in my
 opinion two opposing forces to bring it to light it takes both emotion and logic for outreach your match maximum potential to to really
 give everything you have and go beyond your limit because both emotionality going to reach their limitations you and one fails egeline
 other one so when it doesn't make sense logical sense to go on that's when you got to use your motion eateese that agerhaus tion that fear
 to pastureage the push erself to say i don't stop and when your feelings are screaming as you had enough and when you think you're going
 to break emotionally you override that a motion with the concrete logic stand will power that says you don't want i don't stop it to you
 you fight the weak amoton with the power of logic and of fight the weakness of logic with the power of emotions and in the balance of
 those to nat's where you find less strength and coast and the guts to say yourself i don't stop and you won't and i think that's about it
 for tonight there so thanks to every one portuigale tending to us if you want to continue these conversations you want to join in these
 conversations you canachus through that inter web this antenor a man at jack a willing can of course achochre is at echochee taxallan
 reviews of the port cast on it tunes and of the book on amazon a most of all everyone at out there tony in less name he got your head said
 and you gittin thank you for getting after it in so until next time missus jack and echo out




this is jack pot cast number twelve with the others and me dunkellin sometimes people as come what made me me how did i turn out like this
s where i come from and i go back and i i tone it you know hard cousin grown up and i being in that ocean where it was cold to be hard and
d strong and it was about a presentation those are like the underlying theme so i point it at you know and i could that's real there was
s montani remember from those days that stuck with me my my whole life from him of those from some of that music with an there's other
r things that influenced me as a kid at even even a young race and one of the things that i know influence to be and a very young age in a
a police significant way was he in the movie bridge on the river qui which is a classic or move an atmore pretty much had it all for me and
d i think i can trace my ideas of being a command go and use that word you have kind of a arcata people don't use any more come and no but
t i i think i got it from watching that move without as a kid and if you haven't seen that movie you should check it out for sure because
e it's epic and it's a store of printers for ten american british most learned that ar symptom build the bridge in the middle of the jungle
e and burma for a train line that is to connect a bank cock and ring go in a course these are prisoners so there badly mistreated there
e beaten the poorly sad vente want american escapes and he lied thus a command no true back to the sight of the bridge to blow up the
e bridge and they do it all and the commandos in the movie they do all they perish you the end they swam up the river they lay demolition
n on the bridge like a team operation and one part of the plot though is that the senior british officer at the camp the senior prisoner at
t the camp the name in the in the movies a tenant colonel nicholson he takes a true leadership role in building the brick not think about
t that ease being cast by the japanese to build this bridge and instead of sabotaging the job because it's going to help the japanese he
e actually gets his men fired up and help for an eyes and has his engineers read a in it and they relocated to a better piece of train and
d any pushes his men to do good job building it and he actually takes pride in this bridge and again missus bridson to aid in japanese
e japanese domination so when the commandos show off to blow it up the colonel he he almost foils the attack but the end the bridge is
s destroyed the asimov and it was like i said i was very influential to me as a kid and people should definitely watch it and then you
u should know that it's all a lie a sweet what's all lie there well there really was a bridge on a river qui and it really was built by
y prisoners of war but that's about where the similarities and what the prisoners suffered at the hands of the imperial japanese guards is
s beyond anything that they showed in the movie and really beyond anything that even remotely civilized person could imagine i was oh i was
s overseas recently in europe and i was in britain and a friend of mine gave me a book called the forgotten highlander and he told me you
u know oh it's by one of the soldiers that built the bridge on the reacquire read it then i thought myself all gay you know great it's like
e the movie asad's not like the movies all like the boy at all and it isn't this is a book that shows the ultimate in human desiring and
d through that the ultimate and human will the arthur alce der orca was fresh in the british notary he was sent to sing a poor and when
n sing a polis overrun by the japanese imperial army he ended up in the jungle a princess and a slave by this time mental health had become
e a major issue on the railway we all suffered from depression man were taking their own lives are along the railway men cut their own
n throats put their heads on the railway line and simply walked into the jungle to die men developed the atap stare and just looked
d intently at the father of the hut death soon followed others went mad because a medical conditions caused by vitamin deistic encies and
d some just give up losing their minds and their self control they would fit with any one over nothing at all throwing punches biting
g kicking they need be controlled physically but just could not be calm down it came to a point where something drastic had to be done to
o prevent innocent men being killed by derange fellow prisoners some of whom had reverted to animal instincts but this is on was made to
o build our own lunatic asylum to kate poor souls with the agreement of the japanese the burial party built to six foot square bamboo cages
s the mad men could stand or lie down in these dettensee for my hut and they had a bench to sit on there rereived food and water but sadly
y were largely ignored at night it was awful to hear them in the darkness jabbering in the screaming throwing themselves at the cages the
e man who went in never came out alive death would have been welcome for them it was a dreadful thing to see our fellow human beings caged
d like animals but what else could we do you know as i was preparing for this in a lot of times when on putting notes together i'm thinking
g about this am saying that i'm going to say some comparable thing that i could bring back from some of my experiences and i got nothing
g for you i got me unfor you and this this book is just like that back to the book i turned to god to level times often i felt my prayers
s went on answered but i somehow lived through this madness and i think that some one must have been listening but faith and god could not
t prevent the beatings on the railway which would totally rotten the threat of a rifle but across your head or bambocciate your body for
r ever loomed large for no reason i'll wire whips with lashing to our backs and draw blood on guards would creep up on you and strike the
e open tropical odors on your legs with a bamboo deck causing intense agony often they don't liver at these beatings with such brutality
y and swiftness that you did not see them coming or even know that they were what they were for sometimes you just happen to be in the
e wrong place at the wrong time the corean guard took a certain pleasure in the beatings they had expressed permission to kill prisoners
s without any reference to hire authority but most of them would be satisfied to stop at the sight of the blood trickling the beatings of
f no matter how frequent never got easier to take in fact they got tougher each time i took a beating at chipaway not just at my bones and
d waning muscles but at my will to endure them the deliver the elena was weather to swallow your pride by going down at the first blow at
t retain some of your dignity by taking several blows and standing up to them if you re if you refuse to show that their blows are heard on
n you they would fly into wages and the beating could be severe even fatal from an early period the japanese camp commandant whom i called
d the black prince became ever more inventive with his punishments i could not imagine a more sedisti an evil person on the planet the more
e haines the so called to climb the sicker the sentence under his instructed under his instructions the guards had free rein if they felt
t you deserve something more than a beating it meant taking you aside and make you pick up a large bolter for the rest of the day you had
d to hold the rock over your head in the blazing heat within minutes your already weak and mannered arms would start to twitching tail you
u before long you would have to drop the rock you shall leave the size of a rugby ball or football mindful said you did so without letting
g it fall on your own skull when you let go the guards with pounds fists rifle butts and boots falling into your body until you picked up
p the rock again it would go on all day and if the japanese officers did not think you i learn your lesson sufficiently the punishment
t would be repeat repeated back at camp the black plants was a true basker others called him the can you kid i thought my name suited
d intendant luki will well he was darker than the other japanese soldiers and struggled like royalty his beefy gut protruding from beneath
h his shabby uniform he despised us totally we were scum to him his absolute power over us and capacity for pitilessness for pitiless
s brutality made him so terrifying to me lang before our decision to incarcerate crazy men the japanese had built her own cages the black
k holes as they were known were a higher form of punishment those fortune enough to be locked inside this sematos unfortunate enough to be
e locked inside the same the semi subterranean cages proportions or you could not stand like own or even kneel fully would be kept in for a
a month typically corrigan iron and metal covered the bamboo to intensify the heat and to pride victims of air and any cooling breeze few
w who went in came out alive ye it's ye eumenae unbelievable the black prince's right hand man was sergeant say che non to us breathily as
s doctor death short and squat he took the roll calls and carried out all of the camp commandant orders presumably he was more educated in
n the other japanese coreans but he was evil to the marrow mules and extreme he loved tormenting us he especially revelled than a sickening
g brand of the water torture he had guards pin down his hapless victim before pouring gallons of water down the prisoner's throat easing a
a bucket and hose the man stomach with the swell up from huge volumes of water he would win jump up and down gleefully on the pariser
r stomach sometimes the guards tied barbed wire round the poor soul stomach he survived when a pose was caught stealing from the japanese
e officers store room or if a man turned on a guard they received the next grade on the sliding scale of japanese torture i called that the
e indian rope trick one favoured by indians in the old cowboy films the helpless prisoner would be tattered spread eagle to the ground they
y wrapped wet raton the same string like bark used to lash our bambute around his ankles and wrists and tied him to stake in the ground as
s the return dried the ties which slowly dashit the skin drawing blood and erring in the cinerator age as it pulled limbs from their
r sockets it reduced even the toughest men to agonize screaming and they would be there all day i would almost be glad to get out of camp
p in the mornings just to avoid hearing their cries of unbridled pain it was a way of torturing all of us often when return from a day on
n the railway the men would no longer be there nobody asked where they evanished to i certainly did not want to know after such a horrific
c ordeal at the end of a japanese bayonet would have been welcomed so as time went on eventually no when they showed up thet there their
r pants their shirt their boots their socks and as time went on they pulled out stuff to scottite the jungle as they worked and of venally
y fell apart and one of the worst things to lose is the last thing that a star lost was his boots now and bear feet i had a new challenge
e my feet works streamest from living constantly in the wet boots and the ground was particularly unforgiving the jagged volcanic rocks
s often hiding dispel the surface of topsoil i knew that the souls would harden up but until then i went out to walk like a cripple when he
e using the spade i went be able to use my foot to dig deeper into the soil what have and would require more upper body strength having no
o boots also may be ever frequent trips to the banos though the trees even more unsavoury they were revolting vast open pits later covered
d in after weaken prisoners began to collapse into them and grown as you approached the benas you had to wait through the mud lay it with
h excrement of those discoursers who never quite made it flies and maggots and flies and maggots sworn and wriggled over this foul mash it
t got so bad that we had a bucket of water at the entrance to wash our hut to wash our feet in it all added to the misery it amazing what
t we take for granted as i e to the the left and he goes on to talk about and if if you they had you do with this when you're going through
h it and right in moments avidity i would often think back to my childhood and remember going barefoot during the long hot summers we spent
t down at the aberdeen aberdeenshire fisher fishing village of new nail where i was born so lariano having to go barefoot as feet
t practically falling off and the best i he can do is trying think of the good times in his life when he was forced to go barefoot i you
u think beattie some level of comradery would be critical and this is one of those books were again in almost every military book you to
o hear about beatership and come oderan there's points in his book where that stuff fails fails and this is where he can atal about that
t back to the book i even cast a gated myself forgetting involved for the other prisoners problems once you got started with sentimentality
y and grief uragano it was a selfish tactic but i was desperate to survive i was refusing to let the japanese wind that is like on the
e death march some men found the going easier by teaming up and making a close bond with another prisoner they would fight railway life
e together sharing one ever food they had helping each other wherever they could and always having their back maybe to beating together to
o share the blows in the pain it was not the way for me i watched the heartache of men losing their best powls and suddenly being left
t alone they never leave they never usually lasted very long and soon followed their mates to the grave by now the cuts on my feet and legs
s had turned into painful and dangerous tropical alters when i suffered scrape on the railway or had a rash i could not tend to it until
l yessuki which is like rest tier additive warn't till i was back at camp then i wrapped leaves round the contest night to keep the flies
s off but it was useless and the old were usually spread they rowed your flesh muscle and tendence people were left with deeping holes as
s the flesh only fell away and also would eat deep into your flesh so deep you could sometimes see the white of bone even worse if you are
e not careful they could become gangrenes and many men at last legs that way by improvised amputation without anesthetics or drugs i went
t to the medical hot for vice in common with most of the men tropical as or heading bolt my feet ankles and lower camps i ad a voted the
e medical hot until that point it was said aside from the sleeping huts and about the same size as ours the officer in charge was doctor
r makes matheson a likeable character from pately just outside gozo where he studied medicine he had come to sing a poor about the same
e time as me and with mather in much different circumstances saved my life on this my first encounter with him he would at least save my
y legs smoke under the cloud of black flies the circle outside the hut like a swarm of miniature vultures i entered nervously the
e overpowering distance we had me gasping stepping across the cadaverous forms of five or six men who appeared to be wrapping it dettor
r doctor matheson introduced himself the inot spoken for so many days that when i went to a plain my parched throat failed me here he said
d handing me a half cocoanut cup of water dip this down you i shall hippecat down and sank him asking how his patience were doctor matheson
n in his mid thirties at this point appeared to weary beyond his years he he was probably on self imposed to half rations just a keep so
o spare for his patience the man it spoke highly of him and made of our dog doctors werever as saint refigure the doctor took me by the arm
m and led me down to the far end of the hut away from the men in a soft west coast accent he said half of these men will die within days
s the other half who knows if i had access to some proper clinical treatments drugs or instruments they might live but that is not possible
e as a sure you know i can only nodding the squalors sendeth inside the hut was appalling nocano do for them i asked quite simply not a lot
t i try and give them some hope if nothing else he went on it's easy for these men to give up and when they lose hope the fight dismes to
o see right out of them on countless occasions i have seen two men with the same symptoms and the same physical state and one will die and
d one will make it i can only put that down to sheer will power we do talk about will power i don't think we've ever discussed will power
r at this level and that is what you have do men with the same siftem's in the same physical state and one dies to one lives and the
e doctors only to termination as he thinks it comes down to sheer will power the will strong is a strong force i considered this for a
a moment and looked around the hut you could tell the men who were dying by the look on her face there game was lost before it reached
d their eyes and no amount of positive attitude care for doctor matthewson couching their destiny it certainly was not the medical staff
f fault there hands were tied no blood was firmly on our captors hands i turned myself right then and there that i would not stop fighting
g what can you do for this i asked the doctor lifting a foot on to a banochar tropicalized tropical ulcers a disease of thumbed through and
d fliction do you know what maggots look like maggots i asked frantically inspecting my foot praying that i was subject to some sikoke yes
s maggots tell pictou right up go down to the latrines find yourself a handful of those leave white beast even set them on your old sirs
s they will camp through the dead flesh before you know it you'll be right as rain almost as an after thought he added remembered account
t how many put on carefully you don't want to forget one and leaving it there to eat itself to death i left the medical hout shaking my
y head still wondering if i were being had letting maggot eat my sustained not send particularly appetizing but i was willing to willing to
o try anything i knew i had to stop the rot that was devouring my legs but the trees were nothing more than holes in the ground but now
w with an bulat across them a bunch of jungle leaves usually laid piled near or you took your own folly age or to at paper if there was no
o river water collected for the job at hand i have to go far to find what i was looking for i gingerly scooped up a handful of maggots of
f watching them scorn and wriggle without thinking about it too much i found a quiet spot near by and sat down placing just to three
e hundred nasty all soon by ankle the maggots which were about a carder of an instan instinctively knew it to do they started knowing the
e way it might scan in the most with the most mineself bite the sensation was of tingling unearthly yet not altogether unpleasant until the
e realisation of the maggots were eating your rawfles kinraid back to the forefront of your mind i can still feel that sensation to this
s day but the doctor matheson credit it certainly worked with in dazed the wounds and started to heal and new skin grew back it was a trick
k that i persisted with throughout my time on the railway passing enone other men when i thought i could the file that to day by the way
y the magadthi the hwyfar of it that's crazy how you with kinelike god i you know i kept all never forget that feeling of the magus but he
e he talked about it as not being totally unpleasant canalise it polly could be new it was kind of healing on me now yes i don't call but
t have you been a time ye saw we gain to guy that ah i tried to escape was captured i was unaware that any one in escape until one morning
g a sorry looking chap was dragged up before us he had been orifice beaten his swollen a bloets bertrande unrecognizable the intill this
s man very bad he tried to escape no good to guards through down on the ground in front of us the battle wreck of a human frame and made
e him kneel he did not plead for mercy or beg for assistance he knew his fate and waited sightly resigned to it the black prince who seemed
d to have dressed up especially for the occasion strode forward and oneths long sam risor he prodded the prisoner in the back forcing him
m to straighten up then the black prince raised his sword its stantial glinted in the sunshine it was a moment of such horror that i could
d scarcely believe that was really happening i closed my eyes tightly this was one of the many instances of tarbes on the railway that i
i would try to shut out of my mind but i could not escape the chilling swartsel the blade as it cut through the damp tropical air where the
e sickening swack of the sword coming down on our comrades neck followed by the dull frump of his head landing on the ground i kept my eyes
s firmly shut but swayed on my feet and felt the collective gasp of impotent anger and revulsion and not lie right there is something that
t when i heard it when i read it i kind of thought to myself that this is what separates every experience i'm added my life with this and
d that is this this gas of impotent anger and revulsion so the angers there the revolens there by its impotent and can't do eighty thing
g about it because you are a slave in your at the mercy of another human being your freedom has been taken away that i talked about freedom
m fairly often and i don't think there could be any greater reminder of how precious freedom is then reading about a one about a group of
f men that i had there fleetingly taken from them now at this point in the book and i wanted a point this out because if you had to see in
n the movie that ridgeon the river qui he may some kind spells out the differences the building of the bridge of the river quiet are a
a terrible toll on us and the depiction of our sufferings in the film of the same name was in very very sanitized version of the events on
n like the well fed extras in the movie we did not whistle colonel beget nor did we work alongside americans nor do we have any semblance
e of a uniform we were naked barefoot slaves and there were certainly no pretty and scantly clad local girls of wandering through the
e jungle and contrary the film are we alive commander colonel philip toy did not collaborate with the japanese ill i was not alone in doing
g as little work as possible without blatantly shirking which resulted in sadistic beatings energy every ounce of it had to be conserved
d for survival to music got on starvation rations was absolute suicide we had long lost our dignity and working faster certainly would not
t have brought it back in fact it would have resulted in us in the opposite with even more of us dying instead we made constant attempts to
o sabotage men whispered orders to impair the construction of the bridge wherever possible some charged with making up concrete mixtures
s deliberately added too much sand or not enough which would later have disasters effects we collected a huge numbers of termites and white
e ants and deposited a gross and joints of low bearing charms out of sight of guards i i saw it half way through wooden bolt as whenever
r possible hoping they would snap whenever any serious weight like a train was placed upon them but the river quay and its tributaries
s harboured a killer even more leader the japanese and our starvation diet as the nevile consequence of the lack of sanitation and the tens
s of thousands of bodies buried in shallow graves are dumped along in the jungle the river system was loaded with cholera bacteria and the
e monsoon season became coercion as the heightened waters of the quay of the qui flushed vibrio carry cornelia throughout the land this
s fearful disease cast a black shadow over the camp collar arrived unseen and unheard but soon had us in its grip i was slow to her about
t it but i sent something terrible within the camp more men were falling ill than usual and the japanese kept their distance leaving us
s alone they were scared to death of catching collar of themselves so as wretched disease comes into camp and you just don't think things
s can get worse and they do and you think that alice stores get on for it clara but he doesn't overnight colors drunk me down i woke up
p with explosive dire and violent projectile womaning my ears were ringing as i felt dizzy grant started in my bowels and soon spread all
l over my body as it rapidly dehydrated i was drawing from the inside out he revelling like a picked grade left out mitson the collar of
f bacteria be into the walls of my small intestine producing talks in that sucked my vital salt and every ounce of water out of my body i
i was unsure what was wrong but i knew to be but i knew it was serious i did not want to finish up with life dreamed out of the me i'd
d always been extremely careful to drink only boiled water so at first i was doubtful that it was calera i did not know much about it but i
i knew that the first twenty four hours were crucial if you see through a day in the night you would probably survive most men who
o succumbed did so in the first few hours a horrible death and to so quick men who through the bodies of color of victims on to the fut
t funeral pyres in the morning could easily contract the disease die and be thrown on the fire themselves that evening they died in agony
y like crazed animals and it was dreadful to see i lay in my bed unable to rise for work party by that i was semi conscious and i thought
t it was the end i was a locating vivid red flashes storm my eyelids i knew i had to seek help after psyching myself up on i managed to
o rise and wabble to do doctor matheson's hut as soon as i walked in he do that i had calera it was a death sentence and he was reluctant
t to tell me instead he looked at me and simply said you'll have to be elated you'll be looked after his order he's led me to a cream
m colored tent like the ones we had used in the scouts as they peeled back be tense front flap a deathly sistently doubt unknown to me this
s was the death tent and i was the unlucky thirteen occupant of a dimly lit space and already full of men when i saw their state their eyes
s rolling back rasping unintelligible voices their legs raised with knees bent the bazar telltale side of a coloratura i knew that my
y number was up the orderlies were petting me here to die but the fight was fading from me and i lay down on the canvas floor with a sense
e of complete and utter desolation but he did survive out of the thirteen men that went to the tent he was the only survivor now at this
s point in the book and i want you to remember the visit no book this is another human being is life and at this point in our tears life he
e actually got moved to a nother facility another prison camp that was for people that were really bad bad shape and he was there he went
t through some the recovery time and that's a very important part of the book and then he begins working on the docks you know unloading
g food to doors for the japanese soldiers and loading them and eventually it comes time for him to be moved and so they move the prisners
s of warm by ship in that on four september nineteen forty four nine hundred british fidus were rushed up the gangway of the kotabuki
i marotte thousand ton cargo vessel that had been named for that aenae the president harrison before i was captured from the americans
s using sustineamus droves like cattle aboard the ship and down into the holes we could never move fast enough for them the liner had two
o holds both quite obviously not made to comedy human beings yet they wanted around four hundred and fifty of us in each the lads below
w were shouting begging and pleading for the japanese not to let any more men but the louder they shouted the more frenzy the guards became
e down and down we went into the depths of hell nothing in all of our suffering and prepared me for anything like this and even to day i
i can scarcely find the words to describe the horrors of the cathegorie time i got down to the hold i had nowhere to sit i was standing
g rooney most of us packed in like star sardines with no toilet facilities most had disentrigulated bury and all manners of tropical
l diseases once inside and the whole crammed full the japanese battened down the hatches plunging us into a terrifying black pit at that
t moment the most fearful clamour went up as claustrophobia and panic lip the men many feared they were doomed and began screaming and
d shouting yet a strange tranquillity came over me i felt resigned and just thought this is it i thought that we would never get out alive
e i would never see home again you felt resigned to accept this as your last i could only think that they were taking us out this sea to
o sink the ship and drown us all our capital capable of it i seen what they were capable of anything we do nothing about these ships which
h would become infamous in the annals of the second world war has story as a hell ship a fleet of dozens of rusting holes used to shuttle
e supplies and prisoners around japans far eastern empire some of the most appalling episodes of the war turned on these ships in which men
n driven crazy by thirst killed fellow prisoners to drink their blood in some cases prisoners trying to escape from the seething mass of a
a sterical captives were shot by japanese soldiers some voyages took weeks with only a handful of prizer surviving men drank their own
n urine sick prisoners were trampled to death or suffocated the same murdered the insane and wondered when it would be their turn to go mad
d cannibalism as well as vampirism was not unknown and even japanese made were shocked by what they found when the whole were find the
e opened in the case of the arikaree where insane prisoners killed fellow man for their blood only two hundred and seventy one men survived
d out of one thousand six hundred and nineteen so all those sides aething of horologies and they don't seem realistic and you don't think
k it could ever happen it has happened there must have been at least one officer a war off seruant major somewhere in the whole but they
y certainly didn't make themselves known discipline had gone every one whatever their rank was in the same situation all of us just wanted
d to survive and were prepared to do anything to ensure that happened it would have taken a very brave man to try and take command of the
e men in the whole to these conditions it would have been suicidal it again that's one of those points where you know every book we've
e talked about no matter how bad things yet there is a leader ready to step up then you wonder if there's a line that you could ever go
o cross where that doesn't happen well or is i thought i never thought anything could ever match that terror of the railway being in the
e whole was worse at least slaving on the railway you could move and you had fresh air then another dread thought struck me summaries the
e catchy douar had no red cross markings painted on it i would later learn that some that none of the hellship bore any indication that
t pedestre on board as they were required to do by geneva convention red crosses were however painted on japanese ammunition carriers my
y fears that without markings we were a target for own side so he starts thinking well um where part of the japanese fleet now what if we
e get attacked by our own people what if we get sunk and as you can probably foresee because this story is just a misery upon misery it
t happens in the whole to the cacadore betterment went on the noise was constant in defining and awful coconina of throbbing engines
s moaning coughing and occasional panic stricken screaming the background of music for this latest torture the chilling screams of the mad
d and insane would stop abruptly i don't know how they were dealt with but i could imagine i was completely stuck where i was in the hole
e and could not move no one could you couldn't sit or lie down you could even go down to your haunches there were so little room you didn't
t really want to lie down any way it was a sea of human waste and you rest being trampled you had your space and protected it with your
r life i wait literally you stay strong protecting their space with elbows and fists by any means necessary by this stage it was every man
n for himself each person had their own problems to resolve their own life to save fagin we have not seen this yet every man for himself
f yes the smell and side the whole was indescribable or a pugnastic and overpowering mixture of extreme erin valet sweaty bodies weeping
g all curs and rotting flesh cloates phere there was no way we could get any fresh air even when the japanese opened the hatches it really
y didn't help that much you were still breathing in what was already there thirst became our biggest problem people don't understand what
t we first truly is you start to honte and see mirages and that is the most dangerous thing people died down in a hole from suffocation or
r heartaches the men who died were not taken away their bodies lay among us so one of the other vessels that there out with it take with a
a torpedo merican torpedo at another vessel a holding prisoners of war it is the one thousand three hundred and seventeen were killed or so
o one thousand three hundred seventeen prisoners ran bored none of them were killed by the explosion but one thousand one under fifty nine
e of them drowned or died of exposure in my you these were all guys that had served on the death railway guide that had already suffered
d just on imaginable dorture and then as he suspected they became their turn for minutes later we suddenly felt a tremendous blast and an
n explosion tore through the whole the whole structure shuddered and water fluttered in it from above i knew then as the water crashed on
n top of me that my worst fears had been realized we have been hit and i knew that the torpedo had struck very close to us it was in fact
t the first of two torpedoes that would send the hellship to the bottom within fifteen minutes the ship tilted we were going down so the
e ship sinks now the japanese had immediately treat to get off with life boats at left all the prisoners trying to just create rats with
h one ever they could even after the sinking the killing went on for those of us who survived and go to rafts anyone starting to panic was
s thrown off into the sea when they scrambled to get back they were kicked away men pushed under an hell the japanese men pushed under and
d held under japanese survivors fighting broke out as the animal instinct to survive a servant itself made him some survivors try to
o capture more seaware and shove others of tother deaths many gave up already so weak dangerously dehydrated and ill many goldseam and
d quickly went stark raving mad drowning themselves to end the torment able as it may sound as men became mad they had to be shoved off of
f the rafts or boats or the remainder might have perished perished there was a lot of shouting and screaming cries of get off you master or
r i'll kill you made me close my eyes and distress most of the shouts weren't english there were not many japanese the majority of whom had
d got off early in the life both drowning and dying men called for their wives their children or mothers men said fingers like daddy will
l be home soon and then disappeared beneath the waves it was harrowing to hear by that stage most of us were treading a very fine line
e between sanity and madness it didn't take much to put people over the top i could see where is coming from but a group of men started
d singing first to keep their spirits up they sang rule bretana after the celeritude we had been banned from singing this stirring at them
m with its line about britain never ever being slaves to their estarse some spirit as they start singing rule britannia a celarent was when
n some prisoners of just just when a japanese taking over and sing a foriner me if i now remember this correctly but a couple of guys or
r tried to escape and they got caught and basically with a stand off between the the soldiers and the japanese prisoners or japanese
e present camp commanders and they wouldn't end the soldiers did not back down until they had accentuated for of the four prosers that had
d tried to escape and the nate kept everyone else locked in the ah compound for five days and when the guy started to die from starvation
n and disentrained they based okay wolf man they signed a paper to a noontide but they they held the line as long as they possibly could
d two hundred and forty four of my comrades on the catch of bikari died that night he was tragic beyond the leaf that having survived the
e death railway they became prisoners of the deep one thousand four hundred and three allied service then it died as a result of the
e failure of the japanese to observe the genevieve tion and apply red crosses to our hellship he ends up getting weak after by the japanese
e after the avidities he does survive he gets recapture by the japanese eventually he's close to wear at nagasaki is but fall enough away
y that he doesn't die from the blast of nagasaki the war ends they get picked up and eventually there obviously brought home by americans
s and that venally said back to england he says that when he left aberdeen head weighed a healthy hundredth rty five pounds but here in
n nagasaki on the steelyard scales very ac accurate contractions similar to those i had used at the plumerian i was refused reduced to a
a skeletal eighty two pounds and gasometers of these guides of the day they literally look like skeletons it's it's it's unbelievable that
t they were even able to survive neives men from the vast industrial glad the japanese had created in fun flooded the quay side and length
h in the cue for showers so that basically clean in these guys up now getting ready to promachi and ship of back to america sadly at this
s final hole some did not make it and died on that quay this distressed the americans immensely and they were shocked by the matter fact
t way that the other prisoners excepted the deaths of their mates we had seen so much too much now i think quite possibly though this is
s the have you a book that we've talked about on the pot cast ye ordered and it's one of those things where it's a question if people are
e even gunnoono listen to this and i understand that i understand that some people did not make it through this reading in some people
e listen to it some people are going to buy this book which they should that some people are going to take this as a message from somebody
y who is seen evil in a way that not too many people can claim to it seen in a person that is had there every freedom taken from them and
d there are lives and their destiny put into the hands of sadistic people now if you did make it this far i will let this end on a on n
n incompatibly incredibly positive note and message from the author and he says that my time is a prisoner of the japanese helped shape and
d determine my pass in life just as much as my childhood did like it or not the horrors did happen to me and to thousands of others yet
t some good has come out of it my ordeal has made me a much more patient caring person inspired by the devotion of our hard pressed medic
c on the death railway i was able to care for my young daughter when she was ill and for my late wife who acquired twenty four hour
r attention in the last stages of her life while in japan and working with my friend doctor matheson i vowed to spend the rest of my life
e helping others and i am so pleased to say that i have done so it is where my satisfaction comes from now a days i have tried to use my
y experiences in a positive fashion and of adopted a mode from them which i never tire of telling others there is no such word as camp i
i have not allowed my life to be blighted by bitterness and nighters of age i've lived a long life and continued a livid to the fullest i
i enjoyed a long marriage to my wife and i have been fortunate to have a family and to join their success i have amazed my doctors my
y friends my family and myself by remaining fit i am grateful for my present way of life after all the turmoil that life is thrown at me
e and thankful to have retained my sense of humour most importantly i now visit schools to tell pupils to what really happened in the far
r eastern those torterin war years in my ninety first year i am fortunate enough despite the best efforts of the japanese and perilental
l the vim and vigor required to tell a new generation of how we suffered scandalously or sufferings which have haunted all of us far
r despisers of war throughout our lives were only recognized by the british government in the year two thousand when it offered
d compensation of ten thousand pounds to remaining survivors unbelievably the british tax peter had the pain out that poultry some and not
t the culpable japanese government i hope this book will stand as an indictment of the criminal regime that ran japan during the war years
s and the failure of successive japanese governments to face up to their crimes but i hope too that it will be inspirational and offer hope
e to those who suffer it first of the other daily lives especially in these difficult times life is worth living and no matter what it
t throws at you is important to keep your eyes on the prize of that happiness will come even when the death rail waved us to little more
e than in animals humanity in the shape of our saint we medical officers triumphed over barbarism remember while it seemed while it always
s seemed darkness before the dawn perseverance pays off and the good times will return may health and happiness be yours alice der erhart
t july two thousand nine life is worth living he hethe book is the forgotten highlander it is a phenomenal read it is a reality check it is
s incredibly moving and i i recommend you buy it you read it and you understand what the world is you get a better understanding of what
t the world is about and i know i guess i got a better understanding on what the world is about in reading this there pretty much every
y detail like every every little element that he went through made me think like thing i'd rather i'd probly rather die in that situation
n in every little thing and happened to and there is a nurse obviously thousands of thousands and thousands of men that made that choice
e yet and there will got broken and they just they lost the will to live so it's a credible house strong that human will is that you can
n survive that he to pounds this entrecote also in your legs put in maggots on your legs you know i mean it's just an it's truly incredible
e what that what the human can survive and it's also true incredible with the human can complain about in this day and age right i mean an
n can compare about just the most ridiculous things yer just the most ridiculous things yea the scatebat spectre miss yet disrobing me to
o never complain about anything ever again you know what i mean in you don't do let me complain about anything ever again an consider
r myself a big complainer but come on this is just we have no reason to complain about anything be yet men let's crazy to is one of one of
f the heavier parts there where i felt it was when he talked about the clustered yea know you have an issue in it it's there by is not
t netson too presentative to it but it's something i know i feel that that that's like a tough one to get over you know the tantisper ll
l going through all that stuff first and that you no death a clot on don't know man i might be to have for me well was too avitor a lot of
f people and ye i mean it's almost like ye yowe almost don't need to have a discussion about this book the magnetist stopped talking about
t it every one go read it i get it now and just less move on you know as the cause yotlik like i said it is makes you realize just use what
t kind of suffering there can be and how good you've goed how good you've got it i want to go to bed night in my bed nasone good
d youthinasia that my preciated every night ye yes to cause you think about like some little things you don't even think about but they're
e like a real luxury it it's just things that you really enjoy which i don't even think about it entusiasmo me i really like a nice cold
d you don't beg of bottle awater you know i have a big just a big bottle water i completely take it for grantei go to work it genatum of
f hiccups and fair filius old mice intereat not i oh i don't think anything about that you do that would be like heaven even and that he at
t deconocio bed at night you just roll into the tote the five hundred threadeth severson of sheep as etaient are as the count conacht and
d seats at are all nice eh you climbing to those you don't think about that you're not thankful for that every night yes but pretty much
h everything like a yorite thing pretty much everything even like a theniorita ran now ye like it consider that compared to that what you
u jesrad there just was just bringing a astarita let us break it down with air yea yea yea the the beginning i remember em the cable gay
y was coming waarom silly i know and am and he was late usbec at miss he was the cut off right where i was going to call you like you know
w before it stronger there will go repates leonato fifteen or something and i to go i want to see good to work out or something this is
s getting worse and worse i know that the noteable points get a hot the afford mieyeninu like but all night long on us you know he he's
s fixing not fixing me for under no i am brandenstein yes and yes that that's one of the things i thought of primarily when you said think
k of all the little luxury to not only in not only in my complaining in about something i don't need i'ominie about something that i'm kid
d like a subsistere luxury i'm complaining about that you know because it didn't come a fifteen minutes of all things umber the time that
t it did yes i gontchareff to god idea i meecher myself too so which that lets a what's got to some question from the internet and actually
y to start this one of em after the last pot cast number eleven when i had lay fawn and we talked about mark it duckboard lee we talked
d about rindoe and talked about chris kyle and ill we actually didn't talk about mighty months or so i had a couple of people ask me he why
y do you ask talk about my hemanta while the the the simple reason is he's kind of similar the reason why i hadn't talked about marked
d right and chris yet either until i got lay fan because lay for the the charm patooan er those guys were in charlie paton and i wanted to
o have him on as a you know as as a i don't know what the word i'm looking for it but i wanted to have a guide from his baton on or from
m there paton on to talk about him and i just that's the way i felt and so that's what i stop with with mike mike was dealt up to and i i
i can promise you i will be talking about mike at some point on this mike you was just for nominal anded hero and a saint and how i
i actually absolutely be covering his life and how he died and how we remembered him then how we remember him still but i i really just
t want to get you know somebody from his paton that was you know right with him ah the whole time and necessities the asheous it so that's
s one of an o do and yet susie my key so it was mike will make will definitely we don't will have a show for my habsolutely mike deserves
s that held shone a and we laid for my so be ready for that i don't know whom we get water his lot a godsend to her to on active duty ah
h the portinari on active duty the ah all his good friends are still on active duty so it's going to be tough it's goin t be tougher and
d might take a little bit of time but that's the plan then it'll be worth it so let's go to the next question jocko regarding mistakes what
t are some of your own and some you seem made by leaders you looked up to and otter recover can some one ever fully regained trust is as
s actually for easy one because umlaou make mistake on it ah the the worst thing you can do if you make mistake is trying to void takbar it
t that's the worst thing you can do and if you think about the bosses that you've had that you had some boss of made mistake and he's like
e dewanny fault eudestet for him so you can't do that you got to take you out to take ownership of it um he gives any again if you did not
t the postaya and the times that you had a boss that made excuses you don't have any mercy on them you just ruthful son them you just pick
k up a part and if so that's step number one is um you don't take ownership if you make a mistake and that's how it's always seemed to me
e for a illok up the chinaman you know if i saw a bit at me and mistakes and he took on a ovalifolium you know he knows he intimate will
l support him if they're doing the other thing in their blame erybody else and not taking ershi you're goin have hard time with it and as a
a matter of fact i actually at a metenin of my patons where this is a long time ago i it's you know all the names or long since forgotten
n but we had a we had a a mutely and appleton where we said you know pretty much as ustorio gus we had a we went to the we literally went
t to the commanding officer and so we don't redisguise so you all these ideas that people have of the you know military and of you know we
e obey orders now eurotic o what a little jack as i was we you know we say all you know an we don't warriga were to go to the commanding
g officer and tell him we don't want to work for this guy then creating all set to his full credit he was like lesage's you can't have a
a beauty not of my command not at my team you get sucking he figured out a way to work it out go do your told get in line aloft moutonne
e didn't work and then he fired the cat yes and all he he liked basically made a perfectly clear like this is your one chance and a fire
e then medalist was it was pretty crazy to see this he happened but and i say this on titi wasn't because the guy lack tackle scale was the
e cause he was a tical fit it most to the fortinas because he just cold take any one you know if i he wouldn't listen anybody and so when
n he was making a stake it was with no no it oaths way no okay constant cover up for himself he and obviously it it didn't work out for to
o your meeting he sort of sput him on put him on notice thou's right up assentially yeah but i finalement ng officer i think was really
y just doing the right thing saying looked is you can't have a muiden work that way to is the military get back in there dot your supposed
d to do and then he was like okay i ganapati guy anteneasmus not be good to have every inlisted guy in the patonce forward and say i don't
t want to work with his guy ye that's not a good sign ullagoning job and he was actually a great great cleaning off sir to let an at work
k on the deal kindhered on the deal was echoed say and then i actually the guide took over was one of the best guys i ever worked for if
f not be best and yet i was pretty awesome um inditas far as regaining trust which is the unformation this old host issued as you had met
t that you made a mistake you are automatically regaining trust that's where you start again in trustees goes from there that you follow
w through with what you say you know your case they trying to build drust in relationship that's what you're trying to do in the mining or
r blind to people how you building trust right and if you make a mistake and you say it's by your fault then that's a lie and every one
e knows it ye that that fear is um especially not necessity but in regard segregating trusts of speak um in one one it its mistakes they
y have that fear that all their gannath i don't know what i'm doing the aradna a handle on this you know so doesn't matter it's you know
w doesn't matter it's so much better to go haggies arigato do this can you show hototogisu never done this before he or he never i'm never
r uses goteborg can you give me an indoor this thing and right the worst thing you can do is stepping with a weapon you've never used
d before not now otowaka loadeder an safe in and look like a tilted and give any lovelike a guide is too arrogant and two insecure to ask
k ye esactly it's actually a sign of insecurity of you can't ask when you need some help on something yenissey one peleidean in a position
n and how can justicing nera being to no is like you you come off way more transparent than you think you know people will like i don't
t know something just as small as i name dropping named job someone righteous mention this person named but you really name dropping eidin
n small way ye i people can smell that easover like this stuff stuff that's a little bit more important where if a leader in secure about
t some day want to make like anotheh but he really disforested like that i know but a ityania an i do stuff like that idea of god as did
d undeliberating everyone everyone knows it and a lot of people brother not in touch with that they think that all ianthy don't know
w because i'm just consort of mention it in this all these little things that if sintoist reek of the notion o put it like that i want i'll
l just say like i said you waymore than you think ye you and transparent is this day at age actually has a positive committin of a few know
w that sea but people view always really transparent guy you read you really just tell you what's going on if you're deliberately
y traversing it in a negative way sonlike can see right through you exactly as the s yeh yeh when you're not trenorirolcio difference there
e anatoly true but it is definitely better just to you don't ask inside i don't know that in security to the when you don't feel like
e asking something that's all knocking at noon that lorinser at your insecure what you an eleonore kanus i am stuck on this problem are
e kekyo give me help but as cause i'm oneone don't say all this case it almost you're doing it every three sentences or i have no you
u haven't studied a cause you got to study got a new your tree can really or assif you don't you got alert it oh you got break out the
e bullocks you know it but when you broke out the books and now there's a little bit of stuff that you still onderstand we guess what tis
s as the question ye because your pontlieue knew they should no word now ye you know this is highly likely that ernemont i mean i was a
a radio man for eight years in the supes by the time i was let lieutenant commander in a true i didn't know as much as those you know guy's
s knew about all the new radio ostasiens question is no big deal ye if you are secure in your leadership here you find ask a couple of
f questions it not that big of a dealer but you are not clear and i the people you're not clear to make excuses and that's what that's how
w you levanters is by telleth is really a simple concept you know next question in regard to working out right and training for a sin
n selection and by selection you mean i mean special forces or ranger or see a selection year execration he so jack what do you think of
f rocking as fitness verses just train up so for pepole that don't know what rocking is rocking as putting a back back on a rock sack with
h a bunch of weight in it and walking along distances and to be honest with you really are jogging you know you really going at a pretty
y good pace when you're doing it and that it is hers erupting to attaint in you be cates in the military m taken bring the pain with rock
k at marches forced road marches as what they called the the reckon all o benloyde racking to he don't want to be rocked in a indians you
u know you'll do twenty miles for road march which is just your armored with a fifty pound pack just marching yes and ah so the thing is
s like anything else if you want to get good at it yet i do it right so if you want to get good i be as melanocephala fetors how do you get
t it running run how do you it swing so oh you are not to get good as you gito did you get to a now get on the matinee bunch of ah an you
u want to get good rocking at humpin a rock a carrying weight over long distances rock he cause is all kinds of little things got used to
o her feet attingit prepared and you're gonna get weird mussels your back's got to get stronger you can get you know causes all over your
r feet it takes us special type of fitness regiment to get used to and ready for a long rock marches and especial fitness regiment is
s rocking de and lots of it so ah if you want to eventually you can admit that you know you could start doin squads you can start to
o espronceda ll help you you know as fine but the fallentin of the preparation for rock humping should be rock humping and that's what's
s going to make you good at it so did you do that i did i did and rocking for me actually oddly enough is something that i was at was good
d at no and its weird because i wasn't the fast is springer then i wasn't the best long distance runner which but that maranathema what i's
s fraid and you can't run on disastrous what's wrong with you you can in the middle that i will end the middle incur in on and what i
i realized was that was good for carried a rucksack and i got used to it too because i was radamanthus had her i was at to carry a freaking
g radio you know a thirty pound radio with the water batteries in years it's always happy you decocted up it's only i got used to it i
i suppose it was that more than anything else you like um your fine move termers no i am they'd been e travailla there that time at the end
d they are like man we need to we need to go to those mountains for those you know to avoid the underground worms and they were like a week
k o take the cat and he was like he it's it's slow at all a cat is the big in the but bob cat you know i actually know what a bobcat is i'm
m not sure i know what under ground a worn were artemas one thing completely different but they're bad so they took the cataneo's like now
w we antiphates than all mewlike it doesn't mithionary a ton oiou know it was used like you you're like the cats so they hooked up this big
g trailer which is the rock in your jeany know and they and they drove everybody um you know to the mountain where we deplaned you walk no
o they're trapped on unboton a roof top and there are like robin a star but pier we got to make it to the mountain is like nine miles
s carlyle goin to get there we can't you know we can't run they got to get us we can't you know so it is a will get to cat got there like
e at too slow but there takinaka carry with this big trailer yes you know and i ushshami i my opinion was it was better to be built like a
a four by four and like a poor ye mean was better to be a just cattegara wait around a right or you durable ye what would you rather have
e workington the farm a ford f three fifty or a port eimenos cool for the track when everything's all lined out and dialed the way it's
s billetita kind of train going on you won't that for before and he wanted badenites why you don't know the sea with these guys that were
e kind of more a four by four and then a poor yes he would lead an er in the field in the real seal situation yet in other rateau because
e the the thing about that's that's it's a man a misconception about the seal teams is you know you see guys running on the beach many see
e that swimming in the ocean and they never a carrying anything yeats is complete lie musing every time you do anything in this he will
l teams your caring at tanai with you ye and so you got to be built like a four by foreign alike a poor year ye makes sense though yet you
u way rather some one like you than some sprinter who can run like a fortuity but then you put some you know something on his efforts
s actually you know what you you just want somebody that's durable yea durable is the word yeah an fer great athlete and hacendado awesome
e forty time or they can run a marathon but their just durable it's also yeah okay i'm not trying to milk for admirers around the guys sure
e gethers guise there was a guy with i was a team too and he is a guy actually went through buds with and he was he is he is kunashir guy
y and he was kind of had a odd body shape and so we kind o looked he got out almost like a little pudgy belly and a ideas one of those guys
s and the funny thing is he could run faster menehould bent more than me he had no getting nose asimulate is also gie asika i said you know
w that's cool people say that about him because he's a little bit short he would have but bawdyken i'm like he can he can actually bench
h more than me and he can run fast you can be in all rio well let's just be quiet i i next russian japan do you think that the military
y army navy air force is a young man king gos he this this guy is twenty nine years old and he's about to join up he about to get it on man
n but also a two answers to that question and as usual with answers from me and the icosameron tely there's a dichotomy in the opposing
g other a first of all yes and anybody that says is not a young man's game is not telling the truth because i a game where you goin t be on
n travel you'd be gone to be risking your lives at times you're going to have to put up with a lack of comfort in your world you an you
u living a barrister a man is just going to be it's not it's not creature comforts right if the military is a y spartivento at not the for
r gout in highland or for the love of god but it's but it's definitely more spartan and what the average person has a regular life so to
o anybody to say it's not but young man's game is does not tell the truth because it absolutely is and for me you know i joined when i was
s a kid when i was eighteen years old and it was also i had no attachments in life by i will went to them that station with nothing but
t with that the that's the recusat on where you actually go and i very wistar but it's where you actually leave for the military man i had
d not i had nothing heralded to story thing do what your you know where you descend your man i don't get matters no male that sent to me a
a blank slave and that awesome you don't think about family you don't think about anything you just get in here you get your job dantini
i they say hey we're going to for you to morrow for the eight years you say cool will allow you as bring it day and and you have a bold bad
d get nature because you don't know any better you know you joined the military year your stole you're getting pay check all of a sudden
n you know you got a three hoteo it's all good you know whereas when you are as you know when you're seventeen years old and you're not
t quite putting things together yet a man all of a sudden like i said you got to pay check you got three ones and got you a rock and roll
l they tell you what you do you do it that's good so i do young man's game now that be in said of ours or a dichotomy of that and that is
s that the military is it always in need of guisarme and smart and havener ence in life in that you need to have people like that how you
u get them eventually through the military it but it's also good to have people that want raisin the military vibrates if he can always
s have a little bit of outview and you can learn a little bit from them but what you have to get over if all those things at the young guy
y can eat for breakfast right you know if you twenty nine years old there's a decent chance you've had a pretty nice apartment somewhere
e there's a leecence and left it until you know nine forty five on the weekends there's a decent chance that you stay out till two
o gloctoring and party and you know brother back and you slept in until nine and you might be doing that on the regular london you you've
e got some clothes you watching cable t v you all these things right and then the other the other part of as you might have a family you
u know you've it have a wife you might have kids at twenty doyers old yes you might be established you might have people relying on you not
t just financially but emotion heads to be there so how you can come all that way that's the challenge for the older died now some older
r dancer toninas old they don't have any that yet if it so that case nero you got both that i'm not telling the tear old the whole off on
n him on enlisting in the military don't roll off just get it down get it on and you won't regret it unless you are unless you screw up and
d bringing upon yourself but if you are twenty nine if you can either overcome those obstacles of the things that are going to matins that
t are gonna things that are going to care it you emotionally were right in you a territorio ly now wit's cool is when you're in the
e military and your raised the military you are raised in such a way that those those distractions are easily overcome right you are out of
f your not a compartment is things at least i did to say i know what he understand it's nice to stay home and sleep in in the weekend but
t i'm not going to do it for it cries nice to be all to hang out with your wife and kids but it doesn't matter to leave confectory job that
t that's what you had uplike we can slightly psychopathic but its wear you end up right yes where it's where i antoli's what i ended up as
s you know nothing else matters besides this you ll teams and i don't care about anything else so if you want to be my life cool you
u conditon these giant parameters that's called celticists deal with it that he so joined up maeter twenty nine years old don't get after
r it to that petit next question jack when do you cut your losses or give up on something in a walk when and how to decide to cut beat not
t a quitter too much brain damage brain damage so word i been hearing more for the corporate world actually as people talk but with
h something really hard to do and they just cause i brain an ache by trying to do it and these was actually too questionable metaphor
r obvious that he a yeah it's a encasement for for it and it's better for for i talk about what i was like a beating my head against the
e wall gothinians is one of those things that confuses people because every one hears including us in the sealer the mantra of never never
r quit right never quit and it's not just a mantra that we say it's actually it's actually what we believe is and furthermore it's not just
t what we say and it's not just what we believe but it's literally how we act it so that that drive in that attitude of never quit it's a
a powerful force and it does push you over the edge to victory to victory in many cases but anders always a dichotomy fiesta out everything
g there's a dicotomy to this too because over that attitude you have to lay erasme thing on top of that and that is this basically stricken
n dicision and understanding of the battle field as a whole so you know it's like the the the saying of when the battle lose the war and
d this is the opposite rewives the war meeting oh you you stick to a right now and you might win right now but in the wall run your goin to
o lose this in the opposite where you you're an say not a man to lose his power right now around the win the war the long run so you
u absolutely need to know when you got to stop beating your head against the law you gotta know that i firstly draw my limit at twenty
y seven times after a beat my head against the wall twenty seven times on the twenty eighth time i'm going to say you know what i enthrone
e way to do this on lady this is no battering now the main reason i think why people get caught in the trap of bangor adgans the wall or
r not knowing when to go it is because engin quinteroon work and it's almost hard for me to say right now because it's not knowing when to
o quit that my talk about aethereal in getting the alledge the andantino making in a strict assessment of the unwin of a situation and
d deciding to disengage only suit new can re engage with superior fire power and crush the enemy yet some so there's a big difference
e between that and quitting cording means you curl up into a ball and wait to die that's where would is and ah i don't support that under
r any circumstances so when do you when did it happen were it happens because people get emotional they tootin about whatever it opposable
e in front of them may he crazy about it and they start seeing the obstacle as not only the battle but also as the war and they get
t longsider own determination have seen this with a seal buddesby near so determined that the they will not stop even when it's completely
y detrimental iyo know and and do it would just about everything you know they'll be determined that eighty thing you know that be hurting
g themselves training they'll be you don't determine to drink are than anybody else no evanishing you can throw out of a net to turbine to
o win it that interaction losing yes um so so how do you prevent that from happening it is your half to all the income on them here you
u have you detach you after detach yourself he after you be able to step back away from the promenade look at it from a strategic purpoint
t and say okay what's what's going on here what's the wires what the reward how much of my willing to sacrifice right now and how is that
t sacrifice in a impact me come or or the next day or next week you in then once you've detached and you wah and seen what the real value
e of the dis immediate objective is then you can assassin make a logical decision based not on your emotion but on the actual impact of the
e situation in the overall strategic picture yes then am i your saying you wait a detriment in the in the the rewards and when i think that
t that really makes it real clear when you can assess and de like o all of this were getting all this like all these this detrimental stuff
f one were trying to get this you know this one right benefit renaldo this person or out of this situation or whatever and when you're
e you're using up your resources or sacrificing more resources than you are gaining ground then you know that that seems like a clear time
e to it at the very least start thingbut a disingaging yes and you got it you got it to cash gildonian you get one time people trying pass
s because garnisseuses example ye people just like do one guard pass ye and it doesn't work and they do togantog do to gain it doesn't work
k the day i think go on and on and on until they are exhausted we get mounted and then they get put to that insane in its ancaster were
e stubborn and they didn't do catch in si mean after you've tried to pass a guy's guard fourteen times in a road the same way as a form to
o wise going to work the fifteenth time the answer is it not try something else on otenti solid solid answered teverino as all out at
t tetuanites to training they get like bog down in a bad situation and they would hum they would they would just be striteforard on that
t one problem you know one room in a building they'd be like nocano guys into it said more guys into an ever skin sprayed with pan all and
d put down in the training operation and now to more eyes and eventually every one sister's trading but everyone's dead and there led on
n and on out then you just didn't i got folks on it in a costume so the leaders got to be able to step back and patch and take a look at
t the situation and desired to know what i'm goin to go had up changed course right now not going to quit but i'm no just make us captious
s yes and and that's it's weird how those semantic skin really change your outlook on the whole task when he's when you use the word quit
t verses disengaged or if another one with quit like a citation you know i give it up i mean less as something negative like smoking or
r something like that you quit smoking your geminie up some in that's good but i very smoking a egout any kind of task or anything that
t requires effort if you quit or quote unquote up it's like it's hard to have that sound like a good thing you know dear and one thing
g that's dies you know obviously it applies to combat it if i juditious we just at palanan you look at what you're doing day to day and the
e little things of your life your turn out make orrobin ess that you're trying to make something happen and sometimes people get to so
o addicted to their plane they get so their eagles wrapped around their plan their plan as like fifty per cent fifty per cent tactics and
d technique and its fifty per cent their only ego and so on you cried when that person's plan starts to fail that what they don't want to
o let it go cause it's all wrapped up in the regal so they just push it further telesforo they pursue further and especially if a person in
n cedros tion well then every one kind of just fallen in line and their look anthem they all although they all know when they are the
e bottom the change may all look in this person saying hey bunny's not working i let's disengage new and fall back and figure out a new
w plan of attack and in much we approach the target from a different angle let flank this target so if you're in a business if you're in a
a relationship relates some an you got a situation where you're trying to make something work a certain way and it's not maybe it's got a
a disengage a got come with a different angle of attack so you can get the big wind an he long run ye and with relationships of is it is
s it's the same dynamic but it's different because um what the same because when you're in a lifebringer atshop whatever you venison wife
e um you say so working in please so one of them abusive right mean while the other one's trying to quote unquote make it work and and if
f they end up leaving all you gave up on him you know me you or you you quit not an item pietaeque relationship but you would see you gave
e up on their relationship right ill well he's been abusing her for ten years already you know or in your is twenty seven years you know
w whatever the number is and i and you got to i do not abuse my wife or i ribou know as far as your numbers go but twenty s um but again
n like if you say oh you gave up on the relationship with the cunies kinda like it's the girl's fault on it like mad then she cheek she
e shouldn't a done that almost you know but am yet he disengaged and you minutio are to go for the wind in that relationship and if you
u really want to maintaindrai don't let it be husband wife relationships may be go back to being neighbours or something like that even
n though an abusin perlsucht not work but that i'm disintegratively yeah i'm not sure about all that he surat i do know that if you find
d yourself trying repeatedly to make something happen and it's not happening try different route i don't consider yourself a quitter
r consider yourself a tectosages or attacked his shoe your next question jackal in a fight i a ma or otherwise would you substitute anger
r or rage for aggression would i substitute anger or rage for a gresson's a fight and a otherwise a support actually yes a liseuse finances
s like instead of aggression is it okay us anger or rage elwell i think pretty obviously and people will expect the answer to be for me the
e initial answerers now and i would not substitute anger or rage for aggressive neces ah i think obviously when you let raceace over you or
r thinking any more tea and the mind is a legend the most important weapon and i actually believe that to be true so if you let your rage
e and anger take of you a user mind and that is not good and you actually get this heat this in amaniel regular basis because you'll get
t somebody that is really good at talking smack and they'll get in the other person's head was a man to get the other person's head what do
o i do to him does it make them sad no does it make them not hate the opponent no what does it do to him it makes him angry if it makes
s them frustrate it and that anger leads to frustration which leads to defeat so indian i think it's important i recognised that this
s doziest occur in and the man either curran every day life and a good example to when you get to conversation with somebody you getting to
o bake with somebody you get in on the argument with somebody the minute you get frustrated or angry or enraged you saw the argument a
a right i mean you might you might feel like you want a but you will not win the argument you you lost the argument in the man that that
t happens yet in any yeshonadadekenah because the alien understood your debating your canoeist each other and then as you just went off the
e rails basically right ye it's not good to lucertone in a debate in a conversation for in an memaitch like if you plan chet we are playing
g chess and i was talking back to you you got frustrated and sliptoe chess word yea you are a sad with the with the um you know edgily of
f monumental power whatever whatever the yarrayarra you as well yet you will you lost in a way ye you you absolutely used em so but ideal i
i talk about the alltime is that the rule is he'd never let your emotion getting control so you don't let anger rage overwhelm your little
e brain and now here is the here's the other side of that coin here's the dichotomy and i don't think you can even argue against his cause
e it's he that's pretty sound argument right and they went we just sat on me we seen it we know we know for a fact but rules are made to be
e broken um there are times when a motion caniengas performance i right there on solar and i remember gasiharon up the the soviet union was
s still distorted coconuts and when i would watch like the olympics they would be like machine the soviet no motion as of a aeration ed to
o be like that in often broncoes but i heard a cloak when i was a kid i actually looked for it can wanted to bring it up a confines
s something along the lines of this and that was that soviet the soviet athletes performed better and braces but the americans performed
d better in this datum hum so the americans and that not a universal statement of this plenty of examples of the russians be americans in
n whatever but there's also eatables of were the americans with their emotion and there fireweed beat these russians and mangrave example
e would be the maricle wise on ice and like positioning which is you know that was a bunch of college kids that were fired up and be the
e hardened russian professional hockey team now and in it because only kind of trained their emotions out of it and there's a great kind to
o have your motions strain out of it you know there is a great time where you like you know what i'm not gouty motions play into this a a
a or something about tigeroo and his golf game and he's not thinking about you know the the broad statement as when he is hitting a shot
t and golf he's not thinking about the last night and he's not thinking about the next shot he just think you of that shot right there so
o there's no emotional of whether his yatton or nothing ill eneis is there in that one shot so i think that you know we get people meet
t americans of example i used but i think that people in general caius your motion too to your advantage sometimes but it does take control
l and it takes direction and also i think it's important to remember that it doesn't take long for that extra fire of anger to go from
m making you stronger and faster to make you slower and weaker both meanly and physically so you could get that bursten you're sinfioti all
l time where people punch itself out you know they go arago level savitre and ester swing in for the tarminate even yet oranside think the
e guy that think the guytoun the her locker in the comely bring the thunder for they get they get emotional you know and i think all the
e man when you get a guy that loses his temper wouldn't when somebody was in the separate on the mat it's just a matter of time like i just
t got out a coles got you know he's got three beetles leashes goin to be done so ye you've got a stay came now a couple situations i'm seen
n or beneficial in a and a pretty sure i was trying to remember this for sure but i was cornering dermestes if you don't know german
n stevens is little heathen anima also guy stated fighter and we were training about the time and he was fighting it pretty sure it was in
n in mark's names whose up well respected boxer so really good in may fighter is well but definitely known for his box in well jeremy's
s known for his striking as well as a very balerful striker and he's got unbelievable one punch knock out power dermius so i was contingere
e and it was a really really close fight i'll meet it was a i do know if he was winterless think it was lead in towards markestan and
d there's three rounds in emma in this in this fight and in between the second and the third round i got in the ring got in the cage with
h jeremy and i i did befall on you know it is face and ill i know i gave him the alison this is what's going on this guy crossing from us
s taken money off your kids tablelike food off your kid tawaina take you on the roof off their heads you take in everything that you work
k for he's going to take it from you right now you got to get pistonrod him and i got you i got giafar up speech like that and you could
d see it switching in eyes he realized like he went into a rage of idikut guillotine out that round and knocked him out yander them and
d that's a an i'll tell you another one i saw that was it was the same so it was it was carlos condit verses roaring mc donald and this was
s an this was the first time they fought i put yer was again and i was there i forget who is cornering but i was there and i was done with
h cornerers cornering and i was things peter siboni was corner he was up in canada but am so carlos conduct were rowing mcdonald and carlos
s who's the veteran is going up with kinked know rodion awinkin of an a livin unknown but he was definitely the younger attesters old you
u are just a kid no offence rory but he was young you don't hate mean bad as for young and cornwallis the vat you don't even oweenee grown
n man with a wife and kids and man will rest getting the better for an front of roy's home town well i don't have his home down but it was
s a canada hansard was absolutely supporting rory least am pretty sure i remember this right of sorry if i don't but it seemed like the
e crowd was on the side of roary mc donald he so in between tones watching the fight but i had snaked a really good seat in orderly could
d for matey when i go to c thanks dan a white and the rest of the crew like ice niketas awesome sets after i get a corner yet people so
o thankyou so i was sitting you know in the second row or something to nominal see that i'd mocito and because i tell you the chief seats
s when you're when you're gone epoove out to the wants of fontenaye the nose bleed which is is a cool so i just get aggressive attack we
e moved a better petitions which is using the second row wiegand the press box sir so i'm sit down there and a watch in the fight and gregg
g jackson is cornering carlos cot it now if you don't know anything about grand jackson he is he's passed like a guy and i've actually ah
h go and back in the day going away back in the day when edair competing all the time in the kind of the sole cow seen of grappling we
e would we do every competition there was ane can beat all time grappling my room ever never there so many of them that we do and and a
a great jackson would bring eyes out to to fight to compete in a like we wrestled against these guys i know a week did observing as he
e astounded from that and then surprising me one time when the us was in san diego i was that worn at the heel poems and some one called
d and said haters there's a guy from the u s c here do want to give him a tour of you know he wants a toronto have to set up a tour of the
e selem they want shubrick the futility of her who it is you know the whenever some some guns you know just the gear whatever susanite acon
n and you know we kind o had a little bit of recognition but a anyway greg jackson and you know you kind o hear this stuff about greg jacks
s and all the time that he is this really nice guy and that he is super mellow that he's really humble well if all reenters a super
r disguise he super humble he's just a fantastic die and ah i gave a torn so we kind o got to know each other and then you know going fast
t forward now in the ouse i i of cornered him several times on one time i've quarter against him you know antinomy fighters or fighting his
s fineried said he's a really like a really mellow and eenie i if you watch me the corners of his fights he's always like that josey steady
y and hay this is what you need to do yet watch out for this or whatever some watching this fight and like i said carlos content personated
d carlos's not winning rites not winning and it between a the second in the third round gregan goes full besure i mean he is yellow at him
m he is in his face he point out of his wavin his finger he is going not on him and i was i be grajaos is bringing the heat and sure enough
h he and up calconcillos connect and finished roar in the third which is a fight he was definitely in a loose so what you see there he is
s the motion helping to win in that situation is and ah actually before the fight was over i saw greg and i discoosed something to him you
u know like they did you want for with her obinangoes me and he said i see i had to do it it is funny you could see it i wanted like he'd
d never done it before i know meanwhile have grandon at some point he can tonsoribus he said something a long while if you don't like i had
d to do it in and in it it were a teetotaler smile on and that was working it and it deftly indeed it did work yet and those would you he
e think i'm in this pool gas but do you think that's because those just have him to be the exceptions or is it because really the formula
a kanitseeno like hers the motion and then here's all the logic in the skill and the planning implementation of of you know galitsin all
l the all the stuff that you're going to use in your in your mind and here the motion it's like like a little smart blood or something in
n an am these ly motion can go up but the skill otago up proportionately and once you'd start to do this when the motion takes over that's
s one you know when you're going to fail her or you take advantage tainters sweet spot in there where for moments in time emotion and even
n border lining on rage with i think range is a little bit strong cause i think rage you lose your clarity let anger which is you can still
l have some clarity of what you're doing right so i think you can actually that can be utilized appropriately at the right times and i
i think these times you know what the dorotee you know i had to provoke some anger out of him he you know i had to provoke an absolutely
y helping us gone that fight and is a same thing with carl's calls absolutely good i lose that fight ividint do something different if he
e didn't you know it's like it's like it in the turbot it's like it up when i jesooit is not going taintable the night you saw side blower
r it's only got a get you get me so can make you go a hard for another yet not isn't another to mittel without necessities not dry long at
t all acteau with but with anger you know we can make you go for another m you know ever may be it may be it's too minute and this is
s something else have you er missed like a heavy single like like you at your letting your dad left angornou donolan or something and you
u miss the heavy signal a nineveh done no i have heard a herd o si so this is another easy way to prove it man i miss i have signals
s sometimes and sometimes i just get an gratuities to bring the anger he and i start getting fired up and i start thinking about things
s that make me angry you know and i get all that barn out ripped that thing off the floor like a hate it yes he and it absolutely makes me
e stronger that moment so is that a jest probably a dreadlessly the same thing that pampinea's or orenge man's head its front the same
e thing that part pumpin the carlos i had but it's crazy because despite punched de spiking a beaten despite having some one you know
w trying to destroy you in fort of a large crowd of people none of that was able spireas all spark tejon inasmuch as some kind of a patent
t the notional portion of your mind i bring out just enough rage to get out there and get that job done once for all yes and the end that's
s really the key there just enough for age especially when you're talking about em something that requires technique when you say lifting
g your your like porkenham and um i remember i was in in college and i was going for my one rimac and yet you feel a couple of times but
t for the sake of saving time and stuff you can avail to give you three times won't in my case the there were like forget it three times um
m so the first time i'd gotten all of them i was a pretty solid at partlins that time so's getting all of them and then i got to that point
t em and i didn't get it is three hunt three hundred i weigh one eighty five at the time a toiney eight are you looking for prompt
t righteous that protestations proper memory is talking arrebo when you name dropped and stuffiness i did no i did not on purpley treeferns
s if ereford it cotton my way to leave out that number true true you know you want it to know you wanted to know a much is doing i do you
u anisotoma ter for now you want it already way doesn't matter none the less the first time i failed and it was like no he'll cut this
s you've got this in and had this getting run wood whose name a publind hair like us like you just tough accedit reward and you you always
s get nuts and you like you can't is you didn't you all hear as this and then you make any matter whatever and i didn't outwardly express
s any kind of anger but i felt that anger and politikes technique done the thing it's not like it's just um you know like one i come to
o meeting bench has some to any but ever left this is miss er everything i seknebtunis a little bit more technique than other less you yea
a so it was jeff the perfect amount average you know nescafe a want in a person you are like every stevens he could tell just even the way
y he trains the hesse rag in there yet you oupos to the a roman for example seemingly at an don't watch him trinitarian but it seems like
e he's so periodical in arragon or anger whatever is it is a asmuch of a part and some one like dumanet with a with a problem like crazy
y all yes what are the borges manderton is the way they trained up there at ristori i spent like those to the week end alike hathaway or
r whatever with them with for as an am and rory and it heat froshets head you know that will hold me tsim sure is the hold me iseult as his
s head that you hit the head instead of the mid aloft seems like all that's not that like it seems kind of obvious i never seen the one to
o that and it made weymore beca'se hit midst before and then you when you go to sparklike it it kind of weird you go again used to the
e difference between a heating mit and hating so onstead saw a penetrant these cases chose smart up here in cataracts greedinesse all the
e guys at getting getting a ocean fight man it's also to watch and that that lawler ah mcdonald slight was just a wishes einsamkeit was in
n the same year that fight if you haven't any one has watched that fight was a fight to see ole warmers just blearing in it all and leave
e it at all right there and again to go with that fight ah so did you get the owego the part for yes yes and then when he has the thing a
a bottiaean isn't so you i yeah i got it right and so you go up as the kyoto he go up and wait the next one it was like three o three like
e so permalloy the doolittle had fleeting get the theatre not even clothes on everything was pantalette went aetat one didn't let me see
e where at the all time life my not i just disengaged that's all that will i instigated or said see where it sat youth as you like we
e should go on to the next kirstenin for about one more would say i think so ye will you jack is the ability to switch on and off a
a personal feature or is it a trained skill is this confused with the term peatsmoke what causes that switched flat the overdrive the beast
t moweth full on destroyer that will not stop and he gets actually missus it is something that's lunertick adding in a hard lesson i don't
t think every one get it that exam people go through life without ever getting it and i tell ye it's eight in the borden last nature its
s radicle let each thing that allows you could go the extra distance to dig isoline bit deeper in the pose a little harder gesterin like
e mediate things in life there is a dicotomy cause it actually take in my opinion two opposing forces to bring it to light it takes both
h emotion and logic for outreach your match maximum potential to to really give everything you have and go beyond your limit because both
h emotionality going to reach their limitations you and one fails egeline other one so when it doesn't make sense logical sense to go on
n that's when you got to use your motion eateese that agerhaus tion that fear to pastureage the push erself to say i don't stop and when
n your feelings are screaming as you had enough and when you think you're going to break emotionally you override that a motion with the
e concrete logic stand will power that says you don't want i don't stop it to you you fight the weak amoton with the power of logic and of
f fight the weakness of logic with the power of emotions and in the balance of those to nat's where you find less strength and coast and
d the guts to say yourself i don't stop and you won't and i think that's about it for tonight there so thanks to every one portuigale
e tending to us if you want to continue these conversations you want to join in these conversations you canachus through that inter web
b this antenor a man at jack a willing can of course achochre is at echochee taxallan reviews of the port cast on it tunes and of the book
k on amazon a most of all everyone at out there tony in less name he got your head said and you gittin thank you for getting after it in so
o until next time missus jack and echo out

this is jack pot cast number twelve with the others and me dunkellin sometimes people as come what made me me how did i turn out like thi
s where i come from and i go back and i i tone it you know hard cousin grown up and i being in that ocean where it was cold to be hard an
d strong and it was about a presentation those are like the underlying theme so i point it at you know and i could that's real there wa
s montani remember from those days that stuck with me my my whole life from him of those from some of that music with an there's othe
r things that influenced me as a kid at even even a young race and one of the things that i know influence to be and a very young age in 
a police significant way was he in the movie bridge on the river qui which is a classic or move an atmore pretty much had it all for me an
d i think i can trace my ideas of being a command go and use that word you have kind of a arcata people don't use any more come and no bu
t i i think i got it from watching that move without as a kid and if you haven't seen that movie you should check it out for sure becaus
e it's epic and it's a store of printers for ten american british most learned that ar symptom build the bridge in the middle of the jungl
e and burma for a train line that is to connect a bank cock and ring go in a course these are prisoners so there badly mistreated ther
e beaten the poorly sad vente want american escapes and he lied thus a command no true back to the sight of the bridge to blow up th
e bridge and they do it all and the commandos in the movie they do all they perish you the end they swam up the river they lay demolitio
n on the bridge like a team operation and one part of the plot though is that the senior british officer at the camp the senior prisoner a
t the camp the name in the in the movies a tenant colonel nicholson he takes a true leadership role in building the brick not think abou
t that ease being cast by the japanese to build this bridge and instead of sabotaging the job because it's going to help the japanese h
e actually gets his men fired up and help for an eyes and has his engineers read a in it and they relocated to a better piece of train an
d any pushes his men to do good job building it and he actually takes pride in this bridge and again missus bridson to aid in japanes
e japanese domination so when the commandos show off to blow it up the colonel he he almost foils the attack but the end the bridge i
s destroyed the asimov and it was like i said i was very influential to me as a kid and people should definitely watch it and then yo
u should know that it's all a lie a sweet what's all lie there well there really was a bridge on a river qui and it really was built b
y prisoners of war but that's about where the similarities and what the prisoners suffered at the hands of the imperial japanese guards i
s beyond anything that they showed in the movie and really beyond anything that even remotely civilized person could imagine i was oh i wa
s overseas recently in europe and i was in britain and a friend of mine gave me a book called the forgotten highlander and he told me yo
u know oh it's by one of the soldiers that built the bridge on the reacquire read it then i thought myself all gay you know great it's lik

o prevent innocent men being killed by derange fellow prisoners some of whom had reverted to animal instincts but this is on was made t
o build our own lunatic asylum to kate poor souls with the agreement of the japanese the burial party built to six foot square bamboo cage
s the mad men could stand or lie down in these dettensee for my hut and they had a bench to sit on there rereived food and water but sadl

f men that i had there fleetingly taken from them now at this point in the book and i wanted a point this out because if you had to see i
n the movie that ridgeon the river qui he may some kind spells out the differences the building of the bridge of the river quiet are 
a terrible toll on us and the depiction of our sufferings in the film of the same name was in very very sanitized version of the events o
n like the well fed extras in the movie we did not whistle colonel beget nor did we work alongside americans nor do we have any semblanc
e of a uniform we were naked barefoot slaves and there were certainly no pretty and scantly clad local girls of wandering through th
e jungle and contrary the film are we alive commander colonel philip toy did not collaborate with the japanese ill i was not alone in doin
g as little work as possible without blatantly shirking which resulted in sadistic beatings energy every ounce of it had to be conserve
d for survival to music got on starvation rations was absolute suicide we had long lost our dignity and working faster certainly would no
t have brought it back in fact it would have resulted in us in the opposite with even more of us dying instead we made constant attempts t
o sabotage men whispered orders to impair the construction of the bridge wherever possible some charged with making up concrete mixture
s deliberately added too much sand or not enough which would later have disasters effects we collected a huge numbers of termites and whit
e ants and deposited a gross and joints of low bearing charms out of sight of guards i i saw it half way through wooden bolt as wheneve
r possible hoping they would snap whenever any serious weight like a train was placed upon them but the river quay and its tributarie
s harboured a killer even more leader the japanese and our starvation diet as the nevile consequence of the lack of sanitation and the ten
s of thousands of bodies buried in shallow graves are dumped along in the jungle the river system was loaded with cholera bacteria and th
e monsoon season became coercion as the heightened waters of the quay of the qui flushed vibrio carry cornelia throughout the land thi
s fearful disease cast a black shadow over the camp collar arrived unseen and unheard but soon had us in its grip i was slow to her abou
t it but i sent something terrible within the camp more men were falling ill than usual and the japanese kept their distance leaving u
s alone they were scared to death of catching collar of themselves so as wretched disease comes into camp and you just don't think thing
s can get worse and they do and you think that alice stores get on for it clara but he doesn't overnight colors drunk me down i woke u
p with explosive dire and violent projectile womaning my ears were ringing as i felt dizzy grant started in my bowels and soon spread al
l over my body as it rapidly dehydrated i was drawing from the inside out he revelling like a picked grade left out mitson the collar o
f bacteria be into the walls of my small intestine producing talks in that sucked my vital salt and every ounce of water out of my body 
i was unsure what was wrong but i knew to be but i knew it was serious i did not want to finish up with life dreamed out of the me i'
d always been extremely careful to drink only boiled water so at first i was doubtful that it was calera i did not know much about it but 
i knew that the first twenty four hours were crucial if you see through a day in the night you would probably survive most men wh
o succumbed did so in the first few hours a horrible death and to so quick men who through the bodies of color of victims on to the fu
t funeral pyres in the morning could easily contract the disease die and be thrown on the fire themselves that evening they died in agon
y like crazed animals and it was dreadful to see i lay in my bed unable to rise for work party by that i was semi conscious and i though
t it was the end i was a locating vivid red flashes storm my eyelids i knew i had to seek help after psyching myself up on i managed t
o rise and wabble to do doctor matheson's hut as soon as i walked in he do that i had calera it was a death sentence and he was reluctan
t to tell me instead he looked at me and simply said you'll have to be elated you'll be looked after his order he's led me to a crea
m colored tent like the ones we had used in the scouts as they peeled back be tense front flap a deathly sistently doubt unknown to me thi
s was the death tent and i was the unlucky thirteen occupant of a dimly lit space and already full of men when i saw their state their eye
s rolling back rasping unintelligible voices their legs raised with knees bent the bazar telltale side of a coloratura i knew that m
y number was up the orderlies were petting me here to die but the fight was fading from me and i lay down on the canvas floor with a sens
e of complete and utter desolation but he did survive out of the thirteen men that went to the tent he was the only survivor now at thi
s point in the book and i want you to remember the visit no book this is another human being is life and at this point in our tears life h
e actually got moved to a nother facility another prison camp that was for people that were really bad bad shape and he was there he wen
t through some the recovery time and that's a very important part of the book and then he begins working on the docks you know unloadin
g food to doors for the japanese soldiers and loading them and eventually it comes time for him to be moved and so they move the prisner
s of warm by ship in that on four september nineteen forty four nine hundred british fidus were rushed up the gangway of the kotabuk
i marotte thousand ton cargo vessel that had been named for that aenae the president harrison before i was captured from the american
s using sustineamus droves like cattle aboard the ship and down into the holes we could never move fast enough for them the liner had tw
o holds both quite obviously not made to comedy human beings yet they wanted around four hundred and fifty of us in each the lads belo
w were shouting begging and pleading for the japanese not to let any more men but the louder they shouted the more frenzy the guards becam
e down and down we went into the depths of hell nothing in all of our suffering and prepared me for anything like this and even to day 
i can scarcely find the words to describe the horrors of the cathegorie time i got down to the hold i had nowhere to sit i was standin
g rooney most of us packed in like star sardines with no toilet facilities most had disentrigulated bury and all manners of tropica
l diseases once inside and the whole crammed full the japanese battened down the hatches plunging us into a terrifying black pit at tha
t moment the most fearful clamour went up as claustrophobia and panic lip the men many feared they were doomed and began screaming an
d shouting yet a strange tranquillity came over me i felt resigned and just thought this is it i thought that we would never get out aliv
e i would never see home again you felt resigned to accept this as your last i could only think that they were taking us out this sea t
o sink the ship and drown us all our capital capable of it i seen what they were capable of anything we do nothing about these ships whic
h would become infamous in the annals of the second world war has story as a hell ship a fleet of dozens of rusting holes used to shuttl
e supplies and prisoners around japans far eastern empire some of the most appalling episodes of the war turned on these ships in which me
n driven crazy by thirst killed fellow prisoners to drink their blood in some cases prisoners trying to escape from the seething mass of 
a sterical captives were shot by japanese soldiers some voyages took weeks with only a handful of prizer surviving men drank their ow
n urine sick prisoners were trampled to death or suffocated the same murdered the insane and wondered when it would be their turn to go ma
d cannibalism as well as vampirism was not unknown and even japanese made were shocked by what they found when the whole were find th
e opened in the case of the arikaree where insane prisoners killed fellow man for their blood only two hundred and seventy one men survive
d out of one thousand six hundred and nineteen so all those sides aething of horologies and they don't seem realistic and you don't thin
k it could ever happen it has happened there must have been at least one officer a war off seruant major somewhere in the whole but the
y certainly didn't make themselves known discipline had gone every one whatever their rank was in the same situation all of us just wante
d to survive and were prepared to do anything to ensure that happened it would have taken a very brave man to try and take command of th
e men in the whole to these conditions it would have been suicidal it again that's one of those points where you know every book we'v
e talked about no matter how bad things yet there is a leader ready to step up then you wonder if there's a line that you could ever g
o cross where that doesn't happen well or is i thought i never thought anything could ever match that terror of the railway being in th
e whole was worse at least slaving on the railway you could move and you had fresh air then another dread thought struck me summaries th
e catchy douar had no red cross markings painted on it i would later learn that some that none of the hellship bore any indication tha
t pedestre on board as they were required to do by geneva convention red crosses were however painted on japanese ammunition carriers m
y fears that without markings we were a target for own side so he starts thinking well um where part of the japanese fleet now what if w
e get attacked by our own people what if we get sunk and as you can probably foresee because this story is just a misery upon misery i
t happens in the whole to the cacadore betterment went on the noise was constant in defining and awful coconina of throbbing engine
s moaning coughing and occasional panic stricken screaming the background of music for this latest torture the chilling screams of the ma
d and insane would stop abruptly i don't know how they were dealt with but i could imagine i was completely stuck where i was in the hol
e and could not move no one could you couldn't sit or lie down you could even go down to your haunches there were so little room you didn'
t really want to lie down any way it was a sea of human waste and you rest being trampled you had your space and protected it with you
r life i wait literally you stay strong protecting their space with elbows and fists by any means necessary by this stage it was every ma
n for himself each person had their own problems to resolve their own life to save fagin we have not seen this yet every man for himsel
f yes the smell and side the whole was indescribable or a pugnastic and overpowering mixture of extreme erin valet sweaty bodies weepin
g all curs and rotting flesh cloates phere there was no way we could get any fresh air even when the japanese opened the hatches it reall
y didn't help that much you were still breathing in what was already there thirst became our biggest problem people don't understand wha
t we first truly is you start to honte and see mirages and that is the most dangerous thing people died down in a hole from suffocation o
r heartaches the men who died were not taken away their bodies lay among us so one of the other vessels that there out with it take with 
a torpedo merican torpedo at another vessel a holding prisoners of war it is the one thousand three hundred and seventeen were killed or s
o one thousand three hundred seventeen prisoners ran bored none of them were killed by the explosion but one thousand one under fifty nin
e of them drowned or died of exposure in my you these were all guys that had served on the death railway guide that had already suffere
d just on imaginable dorture and then as he suspected they became their turn for minutes later we suddenly felt a tremendous blast and a
n explosion tore through the whole the whole structure shuddered and water fluttered in it from above i knew then as the water crashed o
n top of me that my worst fears had been realized we have been hit and i knew that the torpedo had struck very close to us it was in fac
t the first of two torpedoes that would send the hellship to the bottom within fifteen minutes the ship tilted we were going down so th
e ship sinks now the japanese had immediately treat to get off with life boats at left all the prisoners trying to just create rats wit
h one ever they could even after the sinking the killing went on for those of us who survived and go to rafts anyone starting to panic wa
s thrown off into the sea when they scrambled to get back they were kicked away men pushed under an hell the japanese men pushed under an
d held under japanese survivors fighting broke out as the animal instinct to survive a servant itself made him some survivors try t
o capture more seaware and shove others of tother deaths many gave up already so weak dangerously dehydrated and ill many goldseam an
d quickly went stark raving mad drowning themselves to end the torment able as it may sound as men became mad they had to be shoved off o
f the rafts or boats or the remainder might have perished perished there was a lot of shouting and screaming cries of get off you master o
r i'll kill you made me close my eyes and distress most of the shouts weren't english there were not many japanese the majority of whom ha
d got off early in the life both drowning and dying men called for their wives their children or mothers men said fingers like daddy wil
l be home soon and then disappeared beneath the waves it was harrowing to hear by that stage most of us were treading a very fine lin
e between sanity and madness it didn't take much to put people over the top i could see where is coming from but a group of men starte

d two hundred and forty four of my comrades on the catch of bikari died that night he was tragic beyond the leaf that having survived th
e death railway they became prisoners of the deep one thousand four hundred and three allied service then it died as a result of th
e failure of the japanese to observe the genevieve tion and apply red crosses to our hellship he ends up getting weak after by the japanes
e after the avidities he does survive he gets recapture by the japanese eventually he's close to wear at nagasaki is but fall enough awa
y that he doesn't die from the blast of nagasaki the war ends they get picked up and eventually there obviously brought home by american
s and that venally said back to england he says that when he left aberdeen head weighed a healthy hundredth rty five pounds but here i
n nagasaki on the steelyard scales very ac accurate contractions similar to those i had used at the plumerian i was refused reduced to 
a skeletal eighty two pounds and gasometers of these guides of the day they literally look like skeletons it's it's it's unbelievable tha
t they were even able to survive neives men from the vast industrial glad the japanese had created in fun flooded the quay side and lengt
h in the cue for showers so that basically clean in these guys up now getting ready to promachi and ship of back to america sadly at thi
s final hole some did not make it and died on that quay this distressed the americans immensely and they were shocked by the matter fac
t way that the other prisoners excepted the deaths of their mates we had seen so much too much now i think quite possibly though this i
s the have you a book that we've talked about on the pot cast ye ordered and it's one of those things where it's a question if people ar
e even gunnoono listen to this and i understand that i understand that some people did not make it through this reading in some peopl
e listen to it some people are going to buy this book which they should that some people are going to take this as a message from somebod
y who is seen evil in a way that not too many people can claim to it seen in a person that is had there every freedom taken from them an
d there are lives and their destiny put into the hands of sadistic people now if you did make it this far i will let this end on a on 
n incompatibly incredibly positive note and message from the author and he says that my time is a prisoner of the japanese helped shape an
d determine my pass in life just as much as my childhood did like it or not the horrors did happen to me and to thousands of others ye
t some good has come out of it my ordeal has made me a much more patient caring person inspired by the devotion of our hard pressed medi
c on the death railway i was able to care for my young daughter when she was ill and for my late wife who acquired twenty four hou
r attention in the last stages of her life while in japan and working with my friend doctor matheson i vowed to spend the rest of my lif

y experiences in a positive fashion and of adopted a mode from them which i never tire of telling others there is no such word as camp 
i have not allowed my life to be blighted by bitterness and nighters of age i've lived a long life and continued a livid to the fullest 
i enjoyed a long marriage to my wife and i have been fortunate to have a family and to join their success i have amazed my doctors m

e and thankful to have retained my sense of humour most importantly i now visit schools to tell pupils to what really happened in the fa
r eastern those torterin war years in my ninety first year i am fortunate enough despite the best efforts of the japanese and perilenta
l the vim and vigor required to tell a new generation of how we suffered scandalously or sufferings which have haunted all of us fa
r despisers of war throughout our lives were only recognized by the british government in the year two thousand when it offere

t the culpable japanese government i hope this book will stand as an indictment of the criminal regime that ran japan during the war year
s and the failure of successive japanese governments to face up to their crimes but i hope too that it will be inspirational and offer hop
e to those who suffer it first of the other daily lives especially in these difficult times life is worth living and no matter what i

t july two thousand nine life is worth living he hethe book is the forgotten highlander it is a phenomenal read it is a reality check it i
s incredibly moving and i i recommend you buy it you read it and you understand what the world is you get a better understanding of wha
t the world is about and i know i guess i got a better understanding on what the world is about in reading this there pretty much ever
y detail like every every little element that he went through made me think like thing i'd rather i'd probly rather die in that situatio
n in every little thing and happened to and there is a nurse obviously thousands of thousands and thousands of men that made that choic
e yet and there will got broken and they just they lost the will to live so it's a credible house strong that human will is that you ca
n survive that he to pounds this entrecote also in your legs put in maggots on your legs you know i mean it's just an it's truly incredibl
e what that what the human can survive and it's also true incredible with the human can complain about in this day and age right i mean a

f the heavier parts there where i felt it was when he talked about the clustered yea know you have an issue in it it's there by is no
t netson too presentative to it but it's something i know i feel that that that's like a tough one to get over you know the tantisper l
l going through all that stuff first and that you no death a clot on don't know man i might be to have for me well was too avitor a lot o

u jesrad there just was just bringing a astarita let us break it down with air yea yea yea the the beginning i remember em the cable ga
y was coming waarom silly i know and am and he was late usbec at miss he was the cut off right where i was going to call you like you kno
w before it stronger there will go repates leonato fifteen or something and i to go i want to see good to work out or something this i
s getting worse and worse i know that the noteable points get a hot the afford mieyeninu like but all night long on us you know he he'
s fixing not fixing me for under no i am brandenstein yes and yes that that's one of the things i thought of primarily when you said thin
k of all the little luxury to not only in not only in my complaining in about something i don't need i'ominie about something that i'm ki
d like a subsistere luxury i'm complaining about that you know because it didn't come a fifteen minutes of all things umber the time tha
t it did yes i gontchareff to god idea i meecher myself too so which that lets a what's got to some question from the internet and actuall
y to start this one of em after the last pot cast number eleven when i had lay fawn and we talked about mark it duckboard lee we talke
d about rindoe and talked about chris kyle and ill we actually didn't talk about mighty months or so i had a couple of people ask me he wh
y do you ask talk about my hemanta while the the the simple reason is he's kind of similar the reason why i hadn't talked about marke
d right and chris yet either until i got lay fan because lay for the the charm patooan er those guys were in charlie paton and i wanted t
o have him on as a you know as as a i don't know what the word i'm looking for it but i wanted to have a guide from his baton on or fro
m there paton on to talk about him and i just that's the way i felt and so that's what i stop with with mike mike was dealt up to and i 
i can promise you i will be talking about mike at some point on this mike you was just for nominal anded hero and a saint and how 
i actually absolutely be covering his life and how he died and how we remembered him then how we remember him still but i i really jus
t want to get you know somebody from his paton that was you know right with him ah the whole time and necessities the asheous it so that'
s one of an o do and yet susie my key so it was mike will make will definitely we don't will have a show for my habsolutely mike deserve
s that held shone a and we laid for my so be ready for that i don't know whom we get water his lot a godsend to her to on active duty a
h the portinari on active duty the ah all his good friends are still on active duty so it's going to be tough it's goin t be tougher an
d might take a little bit of time but that's the plan then it'll be worth it so let's go to the next question jocko regarding mistakes wha
t are some of your own and some you seem made by leaders you looked up to and otter recover can some one ever fully regained trust is a
s actually for easy one because umlaou make mistake on it ah the the worst thing you can do if you make mistake is trying to void takbar i
t that's the worst thing you can do and if you think about the bosses that you've had that you had some boss of made mistake and he's lik
e dewanny fault eudestet for him so you can't do that you got to take you out to take ownership of it um he gives any again if you did no
t the postaya and the times that you had a boss that made excuses you don't have any mercy on them you just ruthful son them you just pic
k up a part and if so that's step number one is um you don't take ownership if you make a mistake and that's how it's always seemed to m
e for a illok up the chinaman you know if i saw a bit at me and mistakes and he took on a ovalifolium you know he knows he intimate wil
l support him if they're doing the other thing in their blame erybody else and not taking ershi you're goin have hard time with it and as 
a matter of fact i actually at a metenin of my patons where this is a long time ago i it's you know all the names or long since forgotte
n but we had a we had a a mutely and appleton where we said you know pretty much as ustorio gus we had a we went to the we literally wen
t to the commanding officer and so we don't redisguise so you all these ideas that people have of the you know military and of you know w
e obey orders now eurotic o what a little jack as i was we you know we say all you know an we don't warriga were to go to the commandin
g officer and tell him we don't want to work for this guy then creating all set to his full credit he was like lesage's you can't have 
a beauty not of my command not at my team you get sucking he figured out a way to work it out go do your told get in line aloft moutonn
e didn't work and then he fired the cat yes and all he he liked basically made a perfectly clear like this is your one chance and a fir
e then medalist was it was pretty crazy to see this he happened but and i say this on titi wasn't because the guy lack tackle scale was th
e cause he was a tical fit it most to the fortinas because he just cold take any one you know if i he wouldn't listen anybody and so whe
n he was making a stake it was with no no it oaths way no okay constant cover up for himself he and obviously it it didn't work out for t
o your meeting he sort of sput him on put him on notice thou's right up assentially yeah but i finalement ng officer i think was reall
y just doing the right thing saying looked is you can't have a muiden work that way to is the military get back in there dot your suppose
d to do and then he was like okay i ganapati guy anteneasmus not be good to have every inlisted guy in the patonce forward and say i don'
t want to work with his guy ye that's not a good sign ullagoning job and he was actually a great great cleaning off sir to let an at wor
k on the deal kindhered on the deal was echoed say and then i actually the guide took over was one of the best guys i ever worked for i
f not be best and yet i was pretty awesome um inditas far as regaining trust which is the unformation this old host issued as you had me
t that you made a mistake you are automatically regaining trust that's where you start again in trustees goes from there that you follo
w through with what you say you know your case they trying to build drust in relationship that's what you're trying to do in the mining o
r blind to people how you building trust right and if you make a mistake and you say it's by your fault then that's a lie and every on
e knows it ye that that fear is um especially not necessity but in regard segregating trusts of speak um in one one it its mistakes the
y have that fear that all their gannath i don't know what i'm doing the aradna a handle on this you know so doesn't matter it's you kno
w doesn't matter it's so much better to go haggies arigato do this can you show hototogisu never done this before he or he never i'm neve
r uses goteborg can you give me an indoor this thing and right the worst thing you can do is stepping with a weapon you've never use
d before not now otowaka loadeder an safe in and look like a tilted and give any lovelike a guide is too arrogant and two insecure to as
k ye esactly it's actually a sign of insecurity of you can't ask when you need some help on something yenissey one peleidean in a positio
n and how can justicing nera being to no is like you you come off way more transparent than you think you know people will like i don'
t know something just as small as i name dropping named job someone righteous mention this person named but you really name dropping eidi
n small way ye i people can smell that easover like this stuff stuff that's a little bit more important where if a leader in secure abou
t some day want to make like anotheh but he really disforested like that i know but a ityania an i do stuff like that idea of god as di
d undeliberating everyone everyone knows it and a lot of people brother not in touch with that they think that all ianthy don't kno
w because i'm just consort of mention it in this all these little things that if sintoist reek of the notion o put it like that i want i'l
l just say like i said you waymore than you think ye you and transparent is this day at age actually has a positive committin of a few kno
w that sea but people view always really transparent guy you read you really just tell you what's going on if you're deliberatel
y traversing it in a negative way sonlike can see right through you exactly as the s yeh yeh when you're not trenorirolcio difference ther
e anatoly true but it is definitely better just to you don't ask inside i don't know that in security to the when you don't feel lik
e asking something that's all knocking at noon that lorinser at your insecure what you an eleonore kanus i am stuck on this problem ar
e kekyo give me help but as cause i'm oneone don't say all this case it almost you're doing it every three sentences or i have no yo

e bullocks you know it but when you broke out the books and now there's a little bit of stuff that you still onderstand we guess what ti
s as the question ye because your pontlieue knew they should no word now ye you know this is highly likely that ernemont i mean i was 
a radio man for eight years in the supes by the time i was let lieutenant commander in a true i didn't know as much as those you know guy'
s knew about all the new radio ostasiens question is no big deal ye if you are secure in your leadership here you find ask a couple o

r feet it takes us special type of fitness regiment to get used to and ready for a long rock marches and especial fitness regiment i
s rocking de and lots of it so ah if you want to eventually you can admit that you know you could start doin squads you can start t
o espronceda ll help you you know as fine but the fallentin of the preparation for rock humping should be rock humping and that's what'
s going to make you good at it so did you do that i did i did and rocking for me actually oddly enough is something that i was at was goo
d at no and its weird because i wasn't the fast is springer then i wasn't the best long distance runner which but that maranathema what i'
s fraid and you can't run on disastrous what's wrong with you you can in the middle that i will end the middle incur in on and what 
i realized was that was good for carried a rucksack and i got used to it too because i was radamanthus had her i was at to carry a freakin
g radio you know a thirty pound radio with the water batteries in years it's always happy you decocted up it's only i got used to it 
i suppose it was that more than anything else you like um your fine move termers no i am they'd been e travailla there that time at the en
d they are like man we need to we need to go to those mountains for those you know to avoid the underground worms and they were like a wee
k o take the cat and he was like he it's it's slow at all a cat is the big in the but bob cat you know i actually know what a bobcat is i'
m not sure i know what under ground a worn were artemas one thing completely different but they're bad so they took the cataneo's like no
w we antiphates than all mewlike it doesn't mithionary a ton oiou know it was used like you you're like the cats so they hooked up this bi
g trailer which is the rock in your jeany know and they and they drove everybody um you know to the mountain where we deplaned you walk n
o they're trapped on unboton a roof top and there are like robin a star but pier we got to make it to the mountain is like nine mile
s carlyle goin to get there we can't you know we can't run they got to get us we can't you know so it is a will get to cat got there lik
e at too slow but there takinaka carry with this big trailer yes you know and i ushshami i my opinion was it was better to be built like 
a four by four and like a poor ye mean was better to be a just cattegara wait around a right or you durable ye what would you rather hav
e workington the farm a ford f three fifty or a port eimenos cool for the track when everything's all lined out and dialed the way it'
s billetita kind of train going on you won't that for before and he wanted badenites why you don't know the sea with these guys that wer
e kind of more a four by four and then a poor yes he would lead an er in the field in the real seal situation yet in other rateau becaus
e the the thing about that's that's it's a man a misconception about the seal teams is you know you see guys running on the beach many se
e that swimming in the ocean and they never a carrying anything yeats is complete lie musing every time you do anything in this he wil
l teams your caring at tanai with you ye and so you got to be built like a four by foreign alike a poor year ye makes sense though yet yo
u way rather some one like you than some sprinter who can run like a fortuity but then you put some you know something on his effort
s actually you know what you you just want somebody that's durable yea durable is the word yeah an fer great athlete and hacendado awesom
e forty time or they can run a marathon but their just durable it's also yeah okay i'm not trying to milk for admirers around the guys sur
e gethers guise there was a guy with i was a team too and he is a guy actually went through buds with and he was he is he is kunashir gu
y and he was kind of had a odd body shape and so we kind o looked he got out almost like a little pudgy belly and a ideas one of those guy
s and the funny thing is he could run faster menehould bent more than me he had no getting nose asimulate is also gie asika i said you kno
w that's cool people say that about him because he's a little bit short he would have but bawdyken i'm like he can he can actually benc
h more than me and he can run fast you can be in all rio well let's just be quiet i i next russian japan do you think that the militar
y army navy air force is a young man king gos he this this guy is twenty nine years old and he's about to join up he about to get it on ma
n but also a two answers to that question and as usual with answers from me and the icosameron tely there's a dichotomy in the opposin
g other a first of all yes and anybody that says is not a young man's game is not telling the truth because i a game where you goin t be o
n travel you'd be gone to be risking your lives at times you're going to have to put up with a lack of comfort in your world you an yo
u living a barrister a man is just going to be it's not it's not creature comforts right if the military is a y spartivento at not the fo
r gout in highland or for the love of god but it's but it's definitely more spartan and what the average person has a regular life so t
o anybody to say it's not but young man's game is does not tell the truth because it absolutely is and for me you know i joined when i wa
s a kid when i was eighteen years old and it was also i had no attachments in life by i will went to them that station with nothing bu
t with that the that's the recusat on where you actually go and i very wistar but it's where you actually leave for the military man i ha
d not i had nothing heralded to story thing do what your you know where you descend your man i don't get matters no male that sent to me 
a blank slave and that awesome you don't think about family you don't think about anything you just get in here you get your job dantin
i they say hey we're going to for you to morrow for the eight years you say cool will allow you as bring it day and and you have a bold ba
d get nature because you don't know any better you know you joined the military year your stole you're getting pay check all of a sudde
n you know you got a three hoteo it's all good you know whereas when you are as you know when you're seventeen years old and you're no
t quite putting things together yet a man all of a sudden like i said you got to pay check you got three ones and got you a rock and rol
l they tell you what you do you do it that's good so i do young man's game now that be in said of ours or a dichotomy of that and that i
s that the military is it always in need of guisarme and smart and havener ence in life in that you need to have people like that how yo
u get them eventually through the military it but it's also good to have people that want raisin the military vibrates if he can alway
s have a little bit of outview and you can learn a little bit from them but what you have to get over if all those things at the young gu
y can eat for breakfast right you know if you twenty nine years old there's a decent chance you've had a pretty nice apartment somewher
e there's a leecence and left it until you know nine forty five on the weekends there's a decent chance that you stay out till tw
o gloctoring and party and you know brother back and you slept in until nine and you might be doing that on the regular london you you'v
e got some clothes you watching cable t v you all these things right and then the other the other part of as you might have a family yo
u know you've it have a wife you might have kids at twenty doyers old yes you might be established you might have people relying on you no
t just financially but emotion heads to be there so how you can come all that way that's the challenge for the older died now some olde
r dancer toninas old they don't have any that yet if it so that case nero you got both that i'm not telling the tear old the whole off o
n him on enlisting in the military don't roll off just get it down get it on and you won't regret it unless you are unless you screw up an
d bringing upon yourself but if you are twenty nine if you can either overcome those obstacles of the things that are going to matins tha
t are gonna things that are going to care it you emotionally were right in you a territorio ly now wit's cool is when you're in th
e military and your raised the military you are raised in such a way that those those distractions are easily overcome right you are out o
f your not a compartment is things at least i did to say i know what he understand it's nice to stay home and sleep in in the weekend bu
t i'm not going to do it for it cries nice to be all to hang out with your wife and kids but it doesn't matter to leave confectory job tha
t that's what you had uplike we can slightly psychopathic but its wear you end up right yes where it's where i antoli's what i ended up a
s you know nothing else matters besides this you ll teams and i don't care about anything else so if you want to be my life cool yo
u conditon these giant parameters that's called celticists deal with it that he so joined up maeter twenty nine years old don't get afte
r it to that petit next question jack when do you cut your losses or give up on something in a walk when and how to decide to cut beat no
t a quitter too much brain damage brain damage so word i been hearing more for the corporate world actually as people talk but wit
h something really hard to do and they just cause i brain an ache by trying to do it and these was actually too questionable metapho
r obvious that he a yeah it's a encasement for for it and it's better for for i talk about what i was like a beating my head against th
e wall gothinians is one of those things that confuses people because every one hears including us in the sealer the mantra of never neve
r quit right never quit and it's not just a mantra that we say it's actually it's actually what we believe is and furthermore it's not jus
t what we say and it's not just what we believe but it's literally how we act it so that that drive in that attitude of never quit it's 
a powerful force and it does push you over the edge to victory to victory in many cases but anders always a dichotomy fiesta out everythin
g there's a dicotomy to this too because over that attitude you have to lay erasme thing on top of that and that is this basically stricke
n dicision and understanding of the battle field as a whole so you know it's like the the the saying of when the battle lose the war an
d this is the opposite rewives the war meeting oh you you stick to a right now and you might win right now but in the wall run your goin t
o lose this in the opposite where you you're an say not a man to lose his power right now around the win the war the long run so yo
u absolutely need to know when you got to stop beating your head against the law you gotta know that i firstly draw my limit at twent
y seven times after a beat my head against the wall twenty seven times on the twenty eighth time i'm going to say you know what i enthron
e way to do this on lady this is no battering now the main reason i think why people get caught in the trap of bangor adgans the wall o
r not knowing when to go it is because engin quinteroon work and it's almost hard for me to say right now because it's not knowing when t
o quit that my talk about aethereal in getting the alledge the andantino making in a strict assessment of the unwin of a situation an
d deciding to disengage only suit new can re engage with superior fire power and crush the enemy yet some so there's a big differenc
e between that and quitting cording means you curl up into a ball and wait to die that's where would is and ah i don't support that unde
r any circumstances so when do you when did it happen were it happens because people get emotional they tootin about whatever it opposabl
e in front of them may he crazy about it and they start seeing the obstacle as not only the battle but also as the war and they ge
t longsider own determination have seen this with a seal buddesby near so determined that the they will not stop even when it's completel
y detrimental iyo know and and do it would just about everything you know they'll be determined that eighty thing you know that be hurtin
g themselves training they'll be you don't determine to drink are than anybody else no evanishing you can throw out of a net to turbine t
o win it that interaction losing yes um so so how do you prevent that from happening it is your half to all the income on them here yo
u have you detach you after detach yourself he after you be able to step back away from the promenade look at it from a strategic purpoin
t and say okay what's what's going on here what's the wires what the reward how much of my willing to sacrifice right now and how is tha
t sacrifice in a impact me come or or the next day or next week you in then once you've detached and you wah and seen what the real valu
e of the dis immediate objective is then you can assassin make a logical decision based not on your emotion but on the actual impact of th
e situation in the overall strategic picture yes then am i your saying you wait a detriment in the in the the rewards and when i think tha
t that really makes it real clear when you can assess and de like o all of this were getting all this like all these this detrimental stuf
f one were trying to get this you know this one right benefit renaldo this person or out of this situation or whatever and when you'r
e you're using up your resources or sacrificing more resources than you are gaining ground then you know that that seems like a clear tim
e to it at the very least start thingbut a disingaging yes and you got it you got it to cash gildonian you get one time people trying pas
s because garnisseuses example ye people just like do one guard pass ye and it doesn't work and they do togantog do to gain it doesn't wor
k the day i think go on and on and on until they are exhausted we get mounted and then they get put to that insane in its ancaster wer
e stubborn and they didn't do catch in si mean after you've tried to pass a guy's guard fourteen times in a road the same way as a form t
o wise going to work the fifteenth time the answer is it not try something else on otenti solid solid answered teverino as all out a
t tetuanites to training they get like bog down in a bad situation and they would hum they would they would just be striteforard on tha
t one problem you know one room in a building they'd be like nocano guys into it said more guys into an ever skin sprayed with pan all an
d put down in the training operation and now to more eyes and eventually every one sister's trading but everyone's dead and there led o
n and on out then you just didn't i got folks on it in a costume so the leaders got to be able to step back and patch and take a look a
t the situation and desired to know what i'm goin to go had up changed course right now not going to quit but i'm no just make us captiou
s yes and and that's it's weird how those semantic skin really change your outlook on the whole task when he's when you use the word qui
t verses disengaged or if another one with quit like a citation you know i give it up i mean less as something negative like smoking o
r something like that you quit smoking your geminie up some in that's good but i very smoking a egout any kind of task or anything tha
t requires effort if you quit or quote unquote up it's like it's hard to have that sound like a good thing you know dear and one thin
g that's dies you know obviously it applies to combat it if i juditious we just at palanan you look at what you're doing day to day and th
e little things of your life your turn out make orrobin ess that you're trying to make something happen and sometimes people get to s
o addicted to their plane they get so their eagles wrapped around their plan their plan as like fifty per cent fifty per cent tactics an
d technique and its fifty per cent their only ego and so on you cried when that person's plan starts to fail that what they don't want t
o let it go cause it's all wrapped up in the regal so they just push it further telesforo they pursue further and especially if a person i
n cedros tion well then every one kind of just fallen in line and their look anthem they all although they all know when they are th
e bottom the change may all look in this person saying hey bunny's not working i let's disengage new and fall back and figure out a ne
w plan of attack and in much we approach the target from a different angle let flank this target so if you're in a business if you're in 
a relationship relates some an you got a situation where you're trying to make something work a certain way and it's not maybe it's got 
a disengage a got come with a different angle of attack so you can get the big wind an he long run ye and with relationships of is it i
s it's the same dynamic but it's different because um what the same because when you're in a lifebringer atshop whatever you venison wif
e um you say so working in please so one of them abusive right mean while the other one's trying to quote unquote make it work and and i
f they end up leaving all you gave up on him you know me you or you you quit not an item pietaeque relationship but you would see you gav
e up on their relationship right ill well he's been abusing her for ten years already you know or in your is twenty seven years you kno
w whatever the number is and i and you got to i do not abuse my wife or i ribou know as far as your numbers go but twenty s um but agai
n like if you say oh you gave up on the relationship with the cunies kinda like it's the girl's fault on it like mad then she cheek sh
e shouldn't a done that almost you know but am yet he disengaged and you minutio are to go for the wind in that relationship and if yo
u really want to maintaindrai don't let it be husband wife relationships may be go back to being neighbours or something like that eve
n though an abusin perlsucht not work but that i'm disintegratively yeah i'm not sure about all that he surat i do know that if you fin
d yourself trying repeatedly to make something happen and it's not happening try different route i don't consider yourself a quitte
r consider yourself a tectosages or attacked his shoe your next question jackal in a fight i a ma or otherwise would you substitute ange
r or rage for aggression would i substitute anger or rage for a gresson's a fight and a otherwise a support actually yes a liseuse finance
s like instead of aggression is it okay us anger or rage elwell i think pretty obviously and people will expect the answer to be for me th
e initial answerers now and i would not substitute anger or rage for aggressive neces ah i think obviously when you let raceace over you o
r thinking any more tea and the mind is a legend the most important weapon and i actually believe that to be true so if you let your rag
e and anger take of you a user mind and that is not good and you actually get this heat this in amaniel regular basis because you'll ge
t somebody that is really good at talking smack and they'll get in the other person's head was a man to get the other person's head what d
o i do to him does it make them sad no does it make them not hate the opponent no what does it do to him it makes him angry if it make
s them frustrate it and that anger leads to frustration which leads to defeat so indian i think it's important i recognised that thi
s doziest occur in and the man either curran every day life and a good example to when you get to conversation with somebody you getting t
o bake with somebody you get in on the argument with somebody the minute you get frustrated or angry or enraged you saw the argument 
a right i mean you might you might feel like you want a but you will not win the argument you you lost the argument in the man that tha
t happens yet in any yeshonadadekenah because the alien understood your debating your canoeist each other and then as you just went off th
e rails basically right ye it's not good to lucertone in a debate in a conversation for in an memaitch like if you plan chet we are playin
g chess and i was talking back to you you got frustrated and sliptoe chess word yea you are a sad with the with the um you know edgily o
f monumental power whatever whatever the yarrayarra you as well yet you will you lost in a way ye you you absolutely used em so but ideal 
i talk about the alltime is that the rule is he'd never let your emotion getting control so you don't let anger rage overwhelm your littl
e brain and now here is the here's the other side of that coin here's the dichotomy and i don't think you can even argue against his caus
e it's he that's pretty sound argument right and they went we just sat on me we seen it we know we know for a fact but rules are made to b
e broken um there are times when a motion caniengas performance i right there on solar and i remember gasiharon up the the soviet union wa
s still distorted coconuts and when i would watch like the olympics they would be like machine the soviet no motion as of a aeration ed t
o be like that in often broncoes but i heard a cloak when i was a kid i actually looked for it can wanted to bring it up a confine
s something along the lines of this and that was that soviet the soviet athletes performed better and braces but the americans performe
d better in this datum hum so the americans and that not a universal statement of this plenty of examples of the russians be americans i
n whatever but there's also eatables of were the americans with their emotion and there fireweed beat these russians and mangrave exampl
e would be the maricle wise on ice and like positioning which is you know that was a bunch of college kids that were fired up and be th
e hardened russian professional hockey team now and in it because only kind of trained their emotions out of it and there's a great kind t
o have your motions strain out of it you know there is a great time where you like you know what i'm not gouty motions play into this a 
a or something about tigeroo and his golf game and he's not thinking about you know the the broad statement as when he is hitting a sho
t and golf he's not thinking about the last night and he's not thinking about the next shot he just think you of that shot right there s
o there's no emotional of whether his yatton or nothing ill eneis is there in that one shot so i think that you know we get people mee
t americans of example i used but i think that people in general caius your motion too to your advantage sometimes but it does take contro
l and it takes direction and also i think it's important to remember that it doesn't take long for that extra fire of anger to go fro
m making you stronger and faster to make you slower and weaker both meanly and physically so you could get that bursten you're sinfioti al
l time where people punch itself out you know they go arago level savitre and ester swing in for the tarminate even yet oranside think th
e guy that think the guytoun the her locker in the comely bring the thunder for they get they get emotional you know and i think all th
e man when you get a guy that loses his temper wouldn't when somebody was in the separate on the mat it's just a matter of time like i jus
t got out a coles got you know he's got three beetles leashes goin to be done so ye you've got a stay came now a couple situations i'm see
n or beneficial in a and a pretty sure i was trying to remember this for sure but i was cornering dermestes if you don't know germa
n stevens is little heathen anima also guy stated fighter and we were training about the time and he was fighting it pretty sure it was i
n in mark's names whose up well respected boxer so really good in may fighter is well but definitely known for his box in well jeremy'
s known for his striking as well as a very balerful striker and he's got unbelievable one punch knock out power dermius so i was continger
e and it was a really really close fight i'll meet it was a i do know if he was winterless think it was lead in towards markestan an
d there's three rounds in emma in this in this fight and in between the second and the third round i got in the ring got in the cage wit
h jeremy and i i did befall on you know it is face and ill i know i gave him the alison this is what's going on this guy crossing from u
s taken money off your kids tablelike food off your kid tawaina take you on the roof off their heads you take in everything that you wor
k for he's going to take it from you right now you got to get pistonrod him and i got you i got giafar up speech like that and you coul
d see it switching in eyes he realized like he went into a rage of idikut guillotine out that round and knocked him out yander them an
d that's a an i'll tell you another one i saw that was it was the same so it was it was carlos condit verses roaring mc donald and this wa
s an this was the first time they fought i put yer was again and i was there i forget who is cornering but i was there and i was done wit
h cornerers cornering and i was things peter siboni was corner he was up in canada but am so carlos conduct were rowing mcdonald and carlo
s who's the veteran is going up with kinked know rodion awinkin of an a livin unknown but he was definitely the younger attesters old yo
u are just a kid no offence rory but he was young you don't hate mean bad as for young and cornwallis the vat you don't even oweenee grow
n man with a wife and kids and man will rest getting the better for an front of roy's home town well i don't have his home down but it wa
s a canada hansard was absolutely supporting rory least am pretty sure i remember this right of sorry if i don't but it seemed like th
e crowd was on the side of roary mc donald he so in between tones watching the fight but i had snaked a really good seat in orderly coul
d for matey when i go to c thanks dan a white and the rest of the crew like ice niketas awesome sets after i get a corner yet people s
o thankyou so i was sitting you know in the second row or something to nominal see that i'd mocito and because i tell you the chief seat
s when you're when you're gone epoove out to the wants of fontenaye the nose bleed which is is a cool so i just get aggressive attack w
e moved a better petitions which is using the second row wiegand the press box sir so i'm sit down there and a watch in the fight and greg
g jackson is cornering carlos cot it now if you don't know anything about grand jackson he is he's passed like a guy and i've actually a
h go and back in the day going away back in the day when edair competing all the time in the kind of the sole cow seen of grappling w
e would we do every competition there was ane can beat all time grappling my room ever never there so many of them that we do and and 
a great jackson would bring eyes out to to fight to compete in a like we wrestled against these guys i know a week did observing as h
e astounded from that and then surprising me one time when the us was in san diego i was that worn at the heel poems and some one calle
d and said haters there's a guy from the u s c here do want to give him a tour of you know he wants a toronto have to set up a tour of th
e selem they want shubrick the futility of her who it is you know the whenever some some guns you know just the gear whatever susanite aco
n and you know we kind o had a little bit of recognition but a anyway greg jackson and you know you kind o hear this stuff about greg jack
s and all the time that he is this really nice guy and that he is super mellow that he's really humble well if all reenters a supe
r disguise he super humble he's just a fantastic die and ah i gave a torn so we kind o got to know each other and then you know going fas
t forward now in the ouse i i of cornered him several times on one time i've quarter against him you know antinomy fighters or fighting hi
s fineried said he's a really like a really mellow and eenie i if you watch me the corners of his fights he's always like that josey stead
y and hay this is what you need to do yet watch out for this or whatever some watching this fight and like i said carlos content personate
d carlos's not winning rites not winning and it between a the second in the third round gregan goes full besure i mean he is yellow at hi
m he is in his face he point out of his wavin his finger he is going not on him and i was i be grajaos is bringing the heat and sure enoug
h he and up calconcillos connect and finished roar in the third which is a fight he was definitely in a loose so what you see there he i
s the motion helping to win in that situation is and ah actually before the fight was over i saw greg and i discoosed something to him yo
u know like they did you want for with her obinangoes me and he said i see i had to do it it is funny you could see it i wanted like he'
d never done it before i know meanwhile have grandon at some point he can tonsoribus he said something a long while if you don't like i ha
d to do it in and in it it were a teetotaler smile on and that was working it and it deftly indeed it did work yet and those would you h
e think i'm in this pool gas but do you think that's because those just have him to be the exceptions or is it because really the formul
a kanitseeno like hers the motion and then here's all the logic in the skill and the planning implementation of of you know galitsin al
l the all the stuff that you're going to use in your in your mind and here the motion it's like like a little smart blood or something i
n an am these ly motion can go up but the skill otago up proportionately and once you'd start to do this when the motion takes over that'
s one you know when you're going to fail her or you take advantage tainters sweet spot in there where for moments in time emotion and eve
n border lining on rage with i think range is a little bit strong cause i think rage you lose your clarity let anger which is you can stil
l have some clarity of what you're doing right so i think you can actually that can be utilized appropriately at the right times and 
i think these times you know what the dorotee you know i had to provoke some anger out of him he you know i had to provoke an absolutel
y helping us gone that fight and is a same thing with carl's calls absolutely good i lose that fight ividint do something different if h
e didn't you know it's like it's like it in the turbot it's like it up when i jesooit is not going taintable the night you saw side blowe
r it's only got a get you get me so can make you go a hard for another yet not isn't another to mittel without necessities not dry long a
t all acteau with but with anger you know we can make you go for another m you know ever may be it may be it's too minute and this i
s something else have you er missed like a heavy single like like you at your letting your dad left angornou donolan or something and yo
u miss the heavy signal a nineveh done no i have heard a herd o si so this is another easy way to prove it man i miss i have signal
s sometimes and sometimes i just get an gratuities to bring the anger he and i start getting fired up and i start thinking about thing
s that make me angry you know and i get all that barn out ripped that thing off the floor like a hate it yes he and it absolutely makes m
e stronger that moment so is that a jest probably a dreadlessly the same thing that pampinea's or orenge man's head its front the sam
e thing that part pumpin the carlos i had but it's crazy because despite punched de spiking a beaten despite having some one you kno
w trying to destroy you in fort of a large crowd of people none of that was able spireas all spark tejon inasmuch as some kind of a paten
t the notional portion of your mind i bring out just enough rage to get out there and get that job done once for all yes and the end that'
s really the key there just enough for age especially when you're talking about em something that requires technique when you say liftin
g your your like porkenham and um i remember i was in in college and i was going for my one rimac and yet you feel a couple of times bu
t for the sake of saving time and stuff you can avail to give you three times won't in my case the there were like forget it three times u
m so the first time i'd gotten all of them i was a pretty solid at partlins that time so's getting all of them and then i got to that poin
t em and i didn't get it is three hunt three hundred i weigh one eighty five at the time a toiney eight are you looking for promp

a police significant way was he in the movie bridge on the river qui which is a classic or move an atmore pretty much had it all for me an

e it's epic and it's a store of printers for ten american british most learned that ar symptom build the bridge in the middle of the jungl
e and burma for a train line that is to connect a bank cock and ring go in a course these are prisoners so there badly mistreated ther
e beaten the poorly sad vente want american escapes and he lied thus a command no true back to the sight of the bridge to blow up th
e bridge and they do it all and the commandos in the movie they do all they perish you the end they swam up the river they lay demolitio
n on the bridge like a team operation and one part of the plot though is that the senior british officer at the camp the senior prisoner a
t the camp the name in the in the movies a tenant colonel nicholson he takes a true leadership role in building the brick not think abou
t that ease being cast by the japanese to build this bridge and instead of sabotaging the job because it's going to help the japanese h
e actually gets his men fired up and help for an eyes and has his engineers read a in it and they relocated to a better piece of train an
d any pushes his men to do good job building it and he actually takes pride in this bridge and again missus bridson to aid in japanes
e japanese domination so when the commandos show off to blow it up the colonel he he almost foils the attack but the end the bridge i
s destroyed the asimov and it was like i said i was very influential to me as a kid and people should definitely watch it and then yo
u should know that it's all a lie a sweet what's all lie there well there really was a bridge on a river qui and it really was built b

a terrible toll on us and the depiction of our sufferings in the film of the same name was in very very sanitized version of the events o

o cross where that doesn't happen well or is i thought i never thought anything could ever match that terror of the railway being in th
e whole was worse at least slaving on the railway you could move and you had fresh air then another dread thought struck me summaries th
e catchy douar had no red cross markings painted on it i would later learn that some that none of the hellship bore any indication tha
t pedestre on board as they were required to do by geneva convention red crosses were however painted on japanese ammunition carriers m
y fears that without markings we were a target for own side so he starts thinking well um where part of the japanese fleet now what if w
e get attacked by our own people what if we get sunk and as you can probably foresee because this story is just a misery upon misery i
t happens in the whole to the cacadore betterment went on the noise was constant in defining and awful coconina of throbbing engine
s moaning coughing and occasional panic stricken screaming the background of music for this latest torture the chilling screams of the ma
d and insane would stop abruptly i don't know how they were dealt with but i could imagine i was completely stuck where i was in the hol
e and could not move no one could you couldn't sit or lie down you could even go down to your haunches there were so little room you didn'
t really want to lie down any way it was a sea of human waste and you rest being trampled you had your space and protected it with you
r life i wait literally you stay strong protecting their space with elbows and fists by any means necessary by this stage it was every ma
n for himself each person had their own problems to resolve their own life to save fagin we have not seen this yet every man for himsel
f yes the smell and side the whole was indescribable or a pugnastic and overpowering mixture of extreme erin valet sweaty bodies weepin
g all curs and rotting flesh cloates phere there was no way we could get any fresh air even when the japanese opened the hatches it reall
y didn't help that much you were still breathing in what was already there thirst became our biggest problem people don't understand wha
t we first truly is you start to honte and see mirages and that is the most dangerous thing people died down in a hole from suffocation o
r heartaches the men who died were not taken away their bodies lay among us so one of the other vessels that there out with it take with 
a torpedo merican torpedo at another vessel a holding prisoners of war it is the one thousand three hundred and seventeen were killed or s
o one thousand three hundred seventeen prisoners ran bored none of them were killed by the explosion but one thousand one under fifty nin
e of them drowned or died of exposure in my you these were all guys that had served on the death railway guide that had already suffere
d just on imaginable dorture and then as he suspected they became their turn for minutes later we suddenly felt a tremendous blast and a
n explosion tore through the whole the whole structure shuddered and water fluttered in it from above i knew then as the water crashed o
n top of me that my worst fears had been realized we have been hit and i knew that the torpedo had struck very close to us it was in fac
t the first of two torpedoes that would send the hellship to the bottom within fifteen minutes the ship tilted we were going down so th
e ship sinks now the japanese had immediately treat to get off with life boats at left all the prisoners trying to just create rats wit
h one ever they could even after the sinking the killing went on for those of us who survived and go to rafts anyone starting to panic wa
s thrown off into the sea when they scrambled to get back they were kicked away men pushed under an hell the japanese men pushed under an
d held under japanese survivors fighting broke out as the animal instinct to survive a servant itself made him some survivors try t
o capture more seaware and shove others of tother deaths many gave up already so weak dangerously dehydrated and ill many goldseam an
d quickly went stark raving mad drowning themselves to end the torment able as it may sound as men became mad they had to be shoved off o
f the rafts or boats or the remainder might have perished perished there was a lot of shouting and screaming cries of get off you master o
r i'll kill you made me close my eyes and distress most of the shouts weren't english there were not many japanese the majority of whom ha
d got off early in the life both drowning and dying men called for their wives their children or mothers men said fingers like daddy wil
l be home soon and then disappeared beneath the waves it was harrowing to hear by that stage most of us were treading a very fine lin
e between sanity and madness it didn't take much to put people over the top i could see where is coming from but a group of men starte

d two hundred and forty four of my comrades on the catch of bikari died that night he was tragic beyond the leaf that having survived th
e death railway they became prisoners of the deep one thousand four hundred and three allied service then it died as a result of th
e failure of the japanese to observe the genevieve tion and apply red crosses to our hellship he ends up getting weak after by the japanes
e after the avidities he does survive he gets recapture by the japanese eventually he's close to wear at nagasaki is but fall enough awa
y that he doesn't die from the blast of nagasaki the war ends they get picked up and eventually there obviously brought home by american
s and that venally said back to england he says that when he left aberdeen head weighed a healthy hundredth rty five pounds but here i
n nagasaki on the steelyard scales very ac accurate contractions similar to those i had used at the plumerian i was refused reduced to 
a skeletal eighty two pounds and gasometers of these guides of the day they literally look like skeletons it's it's it's unbelievable tha
t they were even able to survive neives men from the vast industrial glad the japanese had created in fun flooded the quay side and lengt
h in the cue for showers so that basically clean in these guys up now getting ready to promachi and ship of back to america sadly at thi
s final hole some did not make it and died on that quay this distressed the americans immensely and they were shocked by the matter fac
t way that the other prisoners excepted the deaths of their mates we had seen so much too much now i think quite possibly though this i
s the have you a book that we've talked about on the pot cast ye ordered and it's one of those things where it's a question if people ar
e even gunnoono listen to this and i understand that i understand that some people did not make it through this reading in some peopl
e listen to it some people are going to buy this book which they should that some people are going to take this as a message from somebod
y who is seen evil in a way that not too many people can claim to it seen in a person that is had there every freedom taken from them an
d there are lives and their destiny put into the hands of sadistic people now if you did make it this far i will let this end on a on 
n incompatibly incredibly positive note and message from the author and he says that my time is a prisoner of the japanese helped shape an
d determine my pass in life just as much as my childhood did like it or not the horrors did happen to me and to thousands of others ye
t some good has come out of it my ordeal has made me a much more patient caring person inspired by the devotion of our hard pressed medi
c on the death railway i was able to care for my young daughter when she was ill and for my late wife who acquired twenty four hou
r attention in the last stages of her life while in japan and working with my friend doctor matheson i vowed to spend the rest of my lif
e helping others and i am so pleased to say that i have done so it is where my satisfaction comes from now a days i have tried to use m
y experiences in a positive fashion and of adopted a mode from them which i never tire of telling others there is no such word as camp 
i have not allowed my life to be blighted by bitterness and nighters of age i've lived a long life and continued a livid to the fullest 
i enjoyed a long marriage to my wife and i have been fortunate to have a family and to join their success i have amazed my doctors m
y friends my family and myself by remaining fit i am grateful for my present way of life after all the turmoil that life is thrown at m
e and thankful to have retained my sense of humour most importantly i now visit schools to tell pupils to what really happened in the fa
r eastern those torterin war years in my ninety first year i am fortunate enough despite the best efforts of the japanese and perilenta
l the vim and vigor required to tell a new generation of how we suffered scandalously or sufferings which have haunted all of us fa
r despisers of war throughout our lives were only recognized by the british government in the year two thousand when it offere
d compensation of ten thousand pounds to remaining survivors unbelievably the british tax peter had the pain out that poultry some and no
t the culpable japanese government i hope this book will stand as an indictment of the criminal regime that ran japan during the war year
s and the failure of successive japanese governments to face up to their crimes but i hope too that it will be inspirational and offer hop
e to those who suffer it first of the other daily lives especially in these difficult times life is worth living and no matter what i
t throws at you is important to keep your eyes on the prize of that happiness will come even when the death rail waved us to little mor
e than in animals humanity in the shape of our saint we medical officers triumphed over barbarism remember while it seemed while it alway
s seemed darkness before the dawn perseverance pays off and the good times will return may health and happiness be yours alice der erhar
t july two thousand nine life is worth living he hethe book is the forgotten highlander it is a phenomenal read it is a reality check it i
s incredibly moving and i i recommend you buy it you read it and you understand what the world is you get a better understanding of wha
t the world is about and i know i guess i got a better understanding on what the world is about in reading this there pretty much ever
y detail like every every little element that he went through made me think like thing i'd rather i'd probly rather die in that situatio
n in every little thing and happened to and there is a nurse obviously thousands of thousands and thousands of men that made that choic
e yet and there will got broken and they just they lost the will to live so it's a credible house strong that human will is that you ca
n survive that he to pounds this entrecote also in your legs put in maggots on your legs you know i mean it's just an it's truly incredibl
e what that what the human can survive and it's also true incredible with the human can complain about in this day and age right i mean a

o never complain about anything ever again you know what i mean in you don't do let me complain about anything ever again an conside
r myself a big complainer but come on this is just we have no reason to complain about anything be yet men let's crazy to is one of one o
f the heavier parts there where i felt it was when he talked about the clustered yea know you have an issue in it it's there by is no
t netson too presentative to it but it's something i know i feel that that that's like a tough one to get over you know the tantisper l
l going through all that stuff first and that you no death a clot on don't know man i might be to have for me well was too avitor a lot o
f people and ye i mean it's almost like ye yowe almost don't need to have a discussion about this book the magnetist stopped talking abou

h everything like a yorite thing pretty much everything even like a theniorita ran now ye like it consider that compared to that what yo
u jesrad there just was just bringing a astarita let us break it down with air yea yea yea the the beginning i remember em the cable ga
y was coming waarom silly i know and am and he was late usbec at miss he was the cut off right where i was going to call you like you kno
w before it stronger there will go repates leonato fifteen or something and i to go i want to see good to work out or something this i
s getting worse and worse i know that the noteable points get a hot the afford mieyeninu like but all night long on us you know he he'
s fixing not fixing me for under no i am brandenstein yes and yes that that's one of the things i thought of primarily when you said thin
k of all the little luxury to not only in not only in my complaining in about something i don't need i'ominie about something that i'm ki
d like a subsistere luxury i'm complaining about that you know because it didn't come a fifteen minutes of all things umber the time tha
t it did yes i gontchareff to god idea i meecher myself too so which that lets a what's got to some question from the internet and actuall
y to start this one of em after the last pot cast number eleven when i had lay fawn and we talked about mark it duckboard lee we talke
d about rindoe and talked about chris kyle and ill we actually didn't talk about mighty months or so i had a couple of people ask me he wh
y do you ask talk about my hemanta while the the the simple reason is he's kind of similar the reason why i hadn't talked about marke
d right and chris yet either until i got lay fan because lay for the the charm patooan er those guys were in charlie paton and i wanted t
o have him on as a you know as as a i don't know what the word i'm looking for it but i wanted to have a guide from his baton on or fro
m there paton on to talk about him and i just that's the way i felt and so that's what i stop with with mike mike was dealt up to and i 
i can promise you i will be talking about mike at some point on this mike you was just for nominal anded hero and a saint and how 
i actually absolutely be covering his life and how he died and how we remembered him then how we remember him still but i i really jus
t want to get you know somebody from his paton that was you know right with him ah the whole time and necessities the asheous it so that'
s one of an o do and yet susie my key so it was mike will make will definitely we don't will have a show for my habsolutely mike deserve
s that held shone a and we laid for my so be ready for that i don't know whom we get water his lot a godsend to her to on active duty a
h the portinari on active duty the ah all his good friends are still on active duty so it's going to be tough it's goin t be tougher an
d might take a little bit of time but that's the plan then it'll be worth it so let's go to the next question jocko regarding mistakes wha
t are some of your own and some you seem made by leaders you looked up to and otter recover can some one ever fully regained trust is a
s actually for easy one because umlaou make mistake on it ah the the worst thing you can do if you make mistake is trying to void takbar i
t that's the worst thing you can do and if you think about the bosses that you've had that you had some boss of made mistake and he's lik
e dewanny fault eudestet for him so you can't do that you got to take you out to take ownership of it um he gives any again if you did no
t the postaya and the times that you had a boss that made excuses you don't have any mercy on them you just ruthful son them you just pic
k up a part and if so that's step number one is um you don't take ownership if you make a mistake and that's how it's always seemed to m
e for a illok up the chinaman you know if i saw a bit at me and mistakes and he took on a ovalifolium you know he knows he intimate wil
l support him if they're doing the other thing in their blame erybody else and not taking ershi you're goin have hard time with it and as 
a matter of fact i actually at a metenin of my patons where this is a long time ago i it's you know all the names or long since forgotte
n but we had a we had a a mutely and appleton where we said you know pretty much as ustorio gus we had a we went to the we literally wen
t to the commanding officer and so we don't redisguise so you all these ideas that people have of the you know military and of you know w
e obey orders now eurotic o what a little jack as i was we you know we say all you know an we don't warriga were to go to the commandin
g officer and tell him we don't want to work for this guy then creating all set to his full credit he was like lesage's you can't have 
a beauty not of my command not at my team you get sucking he figured out a way to work it out go do your told get in line aloft moutonn
e didn't work and then he fired the cat yes and all he he liked basically made a perfectly clear like this is your one chance and a fir
e then medalist was it was pretty crazy to see this he happened but and i say this on titi wasn't because the guy lack tackle scale was th
e cause he was a tical fit it most to the fortinas because he just cold take any one you know if i he wouldn't listen anybody and so whe
n he was making a stake it was with no no it oaths way no okay constant cover up for himself he and obviously it it didn't work out for t
o your meeting he sort of sput him on put him on notice thou's right up assentially yeah but i finalement ng officer i think was reall
y just doing the right thing saying looked is you can't have a muiden work that way to is the military get back in there dot your suppose
d to do and then he was like okay i ganapati guy anteneasmus not be good to have every inlisted guy in the patonce forward and say i don'
t want to work with his guy ye that's not a good sign ullagoning job and he was actually a great great cleaning off sir to let an at wor
k on the deal kindhered on the deal was echoed say and then i actually the guide took over was one of the best guys i ever worked for i
f not be best and yet i was pretty awesome um inditas far as regaining trust which is the unformation this old host issued as you had me
t that you made a mistake you are automatically regaining trust that's where you start again in trustees goes from there that you follo
w through with what you say you know your case they trying to build drust in relationship that's what you're trying to do in the mining o
r blind to people how you building trust right and if you make a mistake and you say it's by your fault then that's a lie and every on
e knows it ye that that fear is um especially not necessity but in regard segregating trusts of speak um in one one it its mistakes the
y have that fear that all their gannath i don't know what i'm doing the aradna a handle on this you know so doesn't matter it's you kno
w doesn't matter it's so much better to go haggies arigato do this can you show hototogisu never done this before he or he never i'm neve
r uses goteborg can you give me an indoor this thing and right the worst thing you can do is stepping with a weapon you've never use
d before not now otowaka loadeder an safe in and look like a tilted and give any lovelike a guide is too arrogant and two insecure to as
k ye esactly it's actually a sign of insecurity of you can't ask when you need some help on something yenissey one peleidean in a positio
n and how can justicing nera being to no is like you you come off way more transparent than you think you know people will like i don'
t know something just as small as i name dropping named job someone righteous mention this person named but you really name dropping eidi
n small way ye i people can smell that easover like this stuff stuff that's a little bit more important where if a leader in secure abou
t some day want to make like anotheh but he really disforested like that i know but a ityania an i do stuff like that idea of god as di
d undeliberating everyone everyone knows it and a lot of people brother not in touch with that they think that all ianthy don't kno
w because i'm just consort of mention it in this all these little things that if sintoist reek of the notion o put it like that i want i'l
l just say like i said you waymore than you think ye you and transparent is this day at age actually has a positive committin of a few kno
w that sea but people view always really transparent guy you read you really just tell you what's going on if you're deliberatel
y traversing it in a negative way sonlike can see right through you exactly as the s yeh yeh when you're not trenorirolcio difference ther
e anatoly true but it is definitely better just to you don't ask inside i don't know that in security to the when you don't feel lik
e asking something that's all knocking at noon that lorinser at your insecure what you an eleonore kanus i am stuck on this problem ar
e kekyo give me help but as cause i'm oneone don't say all this case it almost you're doing it every three sentences or i have no yo
u haven't studied a cause you got to study got a new your tree can really or assif you don't you got alert it oh you got break out th
e bullocks you know it but when you broke out the books and now there's a little bit of stuff that you still onderstand we guess what ti
s as the question ye because your pontlieue knew they should no word now ye you know this is highly likely that ernemont i mean i was 
a radio man for eight years in the supes by the time i was let lieutenant commander in a true i didn't know as much as those you know guy'
s knew about all the new radio ostasiens question is no big deal ye if you are secure in your leadership here you find ask a couple o
f questions it not that big of a dealer but you are not clear and i the people you're not clear to make excuses and that's what that's ho
w you levanters is by telleth is really a simple concept you know next question in regard to working out right and training for a si
n selection and by selection you mean i mean special forces or ranger or see a selection year execration he so jack what do you think o
f rocking as fitness verses just train up so for pepole that don't know what rocking is rocking as putting a back back on a rock sack wit
h a bunch of weight in it and walking along distances and to be honest with you really are jogging you know you really going at a prett
y good pace when you're doing it and that it is hers erupting to attaint in you be cates in the military m taken bring the pain with roc
k at marches forced road marches as what they called the the reckon all o benloyde racking to he don't want to be rocked in a indians yo
u know you'll do twenty miles for road march which is just your armored with a fifty pound pack just marching yes and ah so the thing i
s like anything else if you want to get good at it yet i do it right so if you want to get good i be as melanocephala fetors how do you ge
t it running run how do you it swing so oh you are not to get good as you gito did you get to a now get on the matinee bunch of ah an yo
u want to get good rocking at humpin a rock a carrying weight over long distances rock he cause is all kinds of little things got used t
o her feet attingit prepared and you're gonna get weird mussels your back's got to get stronger you can get you know causes all over you
r feet it takes us special type of fitness regiment to get used to and ready for a long rock marches and especial fitness regiment i
s rocking de and lots of it so ah if you want to eventually you can admit that you know you could start doin squads you can start t
o espronceda ll help you you know as fine but the fallentin of the preparation for rock humping should be rock humping and that's what'
s going to make you good at it so did you do that i did i did and rocking for me actually oddly enough is something that i was at was goo
d at no and its weird because i wasn't the fast is springer then i wasn't the best long distance runner which but that maranathema what i'
s fraid and you can't run on disastrous what's wrong with you you can in the middle that i will end the middle incur in on and what 
i realized was that was good for carried a rucksack and i got used to it too because i was radamanthus had her i was at to carry a freakin
g radio you know a thirty pound radio with the water batteries in years it's always happy you decocted up it's only i got used to it 
i suppose it was that more than anything else you like um your fine move termers no i am they'd been e travailla there that time at the en
d they are like man we need to we need to go to those mountains for those you know to avoid the underground worms and they were like a wee
k o take the cat and he was like he it's it's slow at all a cat is the big in the but bob cat you know i actually know what a bobcat is i'
m not sure i know what under ground a worn were artemas one thing completely different but they're bad so they took the cataneo's like no
w we antiphates than all mewlike it doesn't mithionary a ton oiou know it was used like you you're like the cats so they hooked up this bi
g trailer which is the rock in your jeany know and they and they drove everybody um you know to the mountain where we deplaned you walk n
o they're trapped on unboton a roof top and there are like robin a star but pier we got to make it to the mountain is like nine mile
s carlyle goin to get there we can't you know we can't run they got to get us we can't you know so it is a will get to cat got there lik
e at too slow but there takinaka carry with this big trailer yes you know and i ushshami i my opinion was it was better to be built like 
a four by four and like a poor ye mean was better to be a just cattegara wait around a right or you durable ye what would you rather hav
e workington the farm a ford f three fifty or a port eimenos cool for the track when everything's all lined out and dialed the way it'
s billetita kind of train going on you won't that for before and he wanted badenites why you don't know the sea with these guys that wer
e kind of more a four by four and then a poor yes he would lead an er in the field in the real seal situation yet in other rateau becaus
e the the thing about that's that's it's a man a misconception about the seal teams is you know you see guys running on the beach many se
e that swimming in the ocean and they never a carrying anything yeats is complete lie musing every time you do anything in this he wil
l teams your caring at tanai with you ye and so you got to be built like a four by foreign alike a poor year ye makes sense though yet yo
u way rather some one like you than some sprinter who can run like a fortuity but then you put some you know something on his effort
s actually you know what you you just want somebody that's durable yea durable is the word yeah an fer great athlete and hacendado awesom
e forty time or they can run a marathon but their just durable it's also yeah okay i'm not trying to milk for admirers around the guys sur
e gethers guise there was a guy with i was a team too and he is a guy actually went through buds with and he was he is he is kunashir gu
y and he was kind of had a odd body shape and so we kind o looked he got out almost like a little pudgy belly and a ideas one of those guy
s and the funny thing is he could run faster menehould bent more than me he had no getting nose asimulate is also gie asika i said you kno
w that's cool people say that about him because he's a little bit short he would have but bawdyken i'm like he can he can actually benc
h more than me and he can run fast you can be in all rio well let's just be quiet i i next russian japan do you think that the militar
y army navy air force is a young man king gos he this this guy is twenty nine years old and he's about to join up he about to get it on ma
n but also a two answers to that question and as usual with answers from me and the icosameron tely there's a dichotomy in the opposin
g other a first of all yes and anybody that says is not a young man's game is not telling the truth because i a game where you goin t be o
n travel you'd be gone to be risking your lives at times you're going to have to put up with a lack of comfort in your world you an yo
u living a barrister a man is just going to be it's not it's not creature comforts right if the military is a y spartivento at not the fo
r gout in highland or for the love of god but it's but it's definitely more spartan and what the average person has a regular life so t
o anybody to say it's not but young man's game is does not tell the truth because it absolutely is and for me you know i joined when i wa
s a kid when i was eighteen years old and it was also i had no attachments in life by i will went to them that station with nothing bu
t with that the that's the recusat on where you actually go and i very wistar but it's where you actually leave for the military man i ha
d not i had nothing heralded to story thing do what your you know where you descend your man i don't get matters no male that sent to me 
a blank slave and that awesome you don't think about family you don't think about anything you just get in here you get your job dantin
i they say hey we're going to for you to morrow for the eight years you say cool will allow you as bring it day and and you have a bold ba
d get nature because you don't know any better you know you joined the military year your stole you're getting pay check all of a sudde
n you know you got a three hoteo it's all good you know whereas when you are as you know when you're seventeen years old and you're no
t quite putting things together yet a man all of a sudden like i said you got to pay check you got three ones and got you a rock and rol
l they tell you what you do you do it that's good so i do young man's game now that be in said of ours or a dichotomy of that and that i
s that the military is it always in need of guisarme and smart and havener ence in life in that you need to have people like that how yo
u get them eventually through the military it but it's also good to have people that want raisin the military vibrates if he can alway
s have a little bit of outview and you can learn a little bit from them but what you have to get over if all those things at the young gu
y can eat for breakfast right you know if you twenty nine years old there's a decent chance you've had a pretty nice apartment somewher
e there's a leecence and left it until you know nine forty five on the weekends there's a decent chance that you stay out till tw
o gloctoring and party and you know brother back and you slept in until nine and you might be doing that on the regular london you you'v
e got some clothes you watching cable t v you all these things right and then the other the other part of as you might have a family yo
u know you've it have a wife you might have kids at twenty doyers old yes you might be established you might have people relying on you no
t just financially but emotion heads to be there so how you can come all that way that's the challenge for the older died now some olde
r dancer toninas old they don't have any that yet if it so that case nero you got both that i'm not telling the tear old the whole off o
n him on enlisting in the military don't roll off just get it down get it on and you won't regret it unless you are unless you screw up an
d bringing upon yourself but if you are twenty nine if you can either overcome those obstacles of the things that are going to matins tha
t are gonna things that are going to care it you emotionally were right in you a territorio ly now wit's cool is when you're in th
e military and your raised the military you are raised in such a way that those those distractions are easily overcome right you are out o
f your not a compartment is things at least i did to say i know what he understand it's nice to stay home and sleep in in the weekend bu
t i'm not going to do it for it cries nice to be all to hang out with your wife and kids but it doesn't matter to leave confectory job tha
t that's what you had uplike we can slightly psychopathic but its wear you end up right yes where it's where i antoli's what i ended up a
s you know nothing else matters besides this you ll teams and i don't care about anything else so if you want to be my life cool yo
u conditon these giant parameters that's called celticists deal with it that he so joined up maeter twenty nine years old don't get afte
r it to that petit next question jack when do you cut your losses or give up on something in a walk when and how to decide to cut beat no
t a quitter too much brain damage brain damage so word i been hearing more for the corporate world actually as people talk but wit
h something really hard to do and they just cause i brain an ache by trying to do it and these was actually too questionable metapho
r obvious that he a yeah it's a encasement for for it and it's better for for i talk about what i was like a beating my head against th
e wall gothinians is one of those things that confuses people because every one hears including us in the sealer the mantra of never neve
r quit right never quit and it's not just a mantra that we say it's actually it's actually what we believe is and furthermore it's not jus
t what we say and it's not just what we believe but it's literally how we act it so that that drive in that attitude of never quit it's 
a powerful force and it does push you over the edge to victory to victory in many cases but anders always a dichotomy fiesta out everythin
g there's a dicotomy to this too because over that attitude you have to lay erasme thing on top of that and that is this basically stricke
n dicision and understanding of the battle field as a whole so you know it's like the the the saying of when the battle lose the war an
d this is the opposite rewives the war meeting oh you you stick to a right now and you might win right now but in the wall run your goin t
o lose this in the opposite where you you're an say not a man to lose his power right now around the win the war the long run so yo
u absolutely need to know when you got to stop beating your head against the law you gotta know that i firstly draw my limit at twent
y seven times after a beat my head against the wall twenty seven times on the twenty eighth time i'm going to say you know what i enthron
e way to do this on lady this is no battering now the main reason i think why people get caught in the trap of bangor adgans the wall o
r not knowing when to go it is because engin quinteroon work and it's almost hard for me to say right now because it's not knowing when t
o quit that my talk about aethereal in getting the alledge the andantino making in a strict assessment of the unwin of a situation an
d deciding to disengage only suit new can re engage with superior fire power and crush the enemy yet some so there's a big differenc
e between that and quitting cording means you curl up into a ball and wait to die that's where would is and ah i don't support that unde
r any circumstances so when do you when did it happen were it happens because people get emotional they tootin about whatever it opposabl
e in front of them may he crazy about it and they start seeing the obstacle as not only the battle but also as the war and they ge
t longsider own determination have seen this with a seal buddesby near so determined that the they will not stop even when it's completel
y detrimental iyo know and and do it would just about everything you know they'll be determined that eighty thing you know that be hurtin
g themselves training they'll be you don't determine to drink are than anybody else no evanishing you can throw out of a net to turbine t
o win it that interaction losing yes um so so how do you prevent that from happening it is your half to all the income on them here yo
u have you detach you after detach yourself he after you be able to step back away from the promenade look at it from a strategic purpoin
t and say okay what's what's going on here what's the wires what the reward how much of my willing to sacrifice right now and how is tha
t sacrifice in a impact me come or or the next day or next week you in then once you've detached and you wah and seen what the real valu
e of the dis immediate objective is then you can assassin make a logical decision based not on your emotion but on the actual impact of th
e situation in the overall strategic picture yes then am i your saying you wait a detriment in the in the the rewards and when i think tha
t that really makes it real clear when you can assess and de like o all of this were getting all this like all these this detrimental stuf
f one were trying to get this you know this one right benefit renaldo this person or out of this situation or whatever and when you'r
e you're using up your resources or sacrificing more resources than you are gaining ground then you know that that seems like a clear tim
e to it at the very least start thingbut a disingaging yes and you got it you got it to cash gildonian you get one time people trying pas
s because garnisseuses example ye people just like do one guard pass ye and it doesn't work and they do togantog do to gain it doesn't wor
k the day i think go on and on and on until they are exhausted we get mounted and then they get put to that insane in its ancaster wer
e stubborn and they didn't do catch in si mean after you've tried to pass a guy's guard fourteen times in a road the same way as a form t
o wise going to work the fifteenth time the answer is it not try something else on otenti solid solid answered teverino as all out a
t tetuanites to training they get like bog down in a bad situation and they would hum they would they would just be striteforard on tha
t one problem you know one room in a building they'd be like nocano guys into it said more guys into an ever skin sprayed with pan all an
d put down in the training operation and now to more eyes and eventually every one sister's trading but everyone's dead and there led o
n and on out then you just didn't i got folks on it in a costume so the leaders got to be able to step back and patch and take a look a
t the situation and desired to know what i'm goin to go had up changed course right now not going to quit but i'm no just make us captiou
s yes and and that's it's weird how those semantic skin really change your outlook on the whole task when he's when you use the word qui
t verses disengaged or if another one with quit like a citation you know i give it up i mean less as something negative like smoking o
r something like that you quit smoking your geminie up some in that's good but i very smoking a egout any kind of task or anything tha
t requires effort if you quit or quote unquote up it's like it's hard to have that sound like a good thing you know dear and one thin
g that's dies you know obviously it applies to combat it if i juditious we just at palanan you look at what you're doing day to day and th
e little things of your life your turn out make orrobin ess that you're trying to make something happen and sometimes people get to s
o addicted to their plane they get so their eagles wrapped around their plan their plan as like fifty per cent fifty per cent tactics an
d technique and its fifty per cent their only ego and so on you cried when that person's plan starts to fail that what they don't want t
o let it go cause it's all wrapped up in the regal so they just push it further telesforo they pursue further and especially if a person i
n cedros tion well then every one kind of just fallen in line and their look anthem they all although they all know when they are th
e bottom the change may all look in this person saying hey bunny's not working i let's disengage new and fall back and figure out a ne
w plan of attack and in much we approach the target from a different angle let flank this target so if you're in a business if you're in 
a relationship relates some an you got a situation where you're trying to make something work a certain way and it's not maybe it's got 
a disengage a got come with a different angle of attack so you can get the big wind an he long run ye and with relationships of is it i
s it's the same dynamic but it's different because um what the same because when you're in a lifebringer atshop whatever you venison wif
e um you say so working in please so one of them abusive right mean while the other one's trying to quote unquote make it work and and i
f they end up leaving all you gave up on him you know me you or you you quit not an item pietaeque relationship but you would see you gav
e up on their relationship right ill well he's been abusing her for ten years already you know or in your is twenty seven years you kno
w whatever the number is and i and you got to i do not abuse my wife or i ribou know as far as your numbers go but twenty s um but agai
n like if you say oh you gave up on the relationship with the cunies kinda like it's the girl's fault on it like mad then she cheek sh
e shouldn't a done that almost you know but am yet he disengaged and you minutio are to go for the wind in that relationship and if yo
u really want to maintaindrai don't let it be husband wife relationships may be go back to being neighbours or something like that eve
n though an abusin perlsucht not work but that i'm disintegratively yeah i'm not sure about all that he surat i do know that if you fin
d yourself trying repeatedly to make something happen and it's not happening try different route i don't consider yourself a quitte
r consider yourself a tectosages or attacked his shoe your next question jackal in a fight i a ma or otherwise would you substitute ange
r or rage for aggression would i substitute anger or rage for a gresson's a fight and a otherwise a support actually yes a liseuse finance
s like instead of aggression is it okay us anger or rage elwell i think pretty obviously and people will expect the answer to be for me th
e initial answerers now and i would not substitute anger or rage for aggressive neces ah i think obviously when you let raceace over you o
r thinking any more tea and the mind is a legend the most important weapon and i actually believe that to be true so if you let your rag
e and anger take of you a user mind and that is not good and you actually get this heat this in amaniel regular basis because you'll ge
t somebody that is really good at talking smack and they'll get in the other person's head was a man to get the other person's head what d
o i do to him does it make them sad no does it make them not hate the opponent no what does it do to him it makes him angry if it make
s them frustrate it and that anger leads to frustration which leads to defeat so indian i think it's important i recognised that thi
s doziest occur in and the man either curran every day life and a good example to when you get to conversation with somebody you getting t
o bake with somebody you get in on the argument with somebody the minute you get frustrated or angry or enraged you saw the argument 
a right i mean you might you might feel like you want a but you will not win the argument you you lost the argument in the man that tha
t happens yet in any yeshonadadekenah because the alien understood your debating your canoeist each other and then as you just went off th
e rails basically right ye it's not good to lucertone in a debate in a conversation for in an memaitch like if you plan chet we are playin
g chess and i was talking back to you you got frustrated and sliptoe chess word yea you are a sad with the with the um you know edgily o
f monumental power whatever whatever the yarrayarra you as well yet you will you lost in a way ye you you absolutely used em so but ideal 
i talk about the alltime is that the rule is he'd never let your emotion getting control so you don't let anger rage overwhelm your littl
e brain and now here is the here's the other side of that coin here's the dichotomy and i don't think you can even argue against his caus
e it's he that's pretty sound argument right and they went we just sat on me we seen it we know we know for a fact but rules are made to b
e broken um there are times when a motion caniengas performance i right there on solar and i remember gasiharon up the the soviet union wa
s still distorted coconuts and when i would watch like the olympics they would be like machine the soviet no motion as of a aeration ed t
o be like that in often broncoes but i heard a cloak when i was a kid i actually looked for it can wanted to bring it up a confine
s something along the lines of this and that was that soviet the soviet athletes performed better and braces but the americans performe
d better in this datum hum so the americans and that not a universal statement of this plenty of examples of the russians be americans i
n whatever but there's also eatables of were the americans with their emotion and there fireweed beat these russians and mangrave exampl
e would be the maricle wise on ice and like positioning which is you know that was a bunch of college kids that were fired up and be th
e hardened russian professional hockey team now and in it because only kind of trained their emotions out of it and there's a great kind t
o have your motions strain out of it you know there is a great time where you like you know what i'm not gouty motions play into this a 
a or something about tigeroo and his golf game and he's not thinking about you know the the broad statement as when he is hitting a sho
t and golf he's not thinking about the last night and he's not thinking about the next shot he just think you of that shot right there s
o there's no emotional of whether his yatton or nothing ill eneis is there in that one shot so i think that you know we get people mee
t americans of example i used but i think that people in general caius your motion too to your advantage sometimes but it does take contro
l and it takes direction and also i think it's important to remember that it doesn't take long for that extra fire of anger to go fro
m making you stronger and faster to make you slower and weaker both meanly and physically so you could get that bursten you're sinfioti al
l time where people punch itself out you know they go arago level savitre and ester swing in for the tarminate even yet oranside think th
e guy that think the guytoun the her locker in the comely bring the thunder for they get they get emotional you know and i think all th
e man when you get a guy that loses his temper wouldn't when somebody was in the separate on the mat it's just a matter of time like i jus
t got out a coles got you know he's got three beetles leashes goin to be done so ye you've got a stay came now a couple situations i'm see
n or beneficial in a and a pretty sure i was trying to remember this for sure but i was cornering dermestes if you don't know germa
n stevens is little heathen anima also guy stated fighter and we were training about the time and he was fighting it pretty sure it was i
n in mark's names whose up well respected boxer so really good in may fighter is well but definitely known for his box in well jeremy'
s known for his striking as well as a very balerful striker and he's got unbelievable one punch knock out power dermius so i was continger
e and it was a really really close fight i'll meet it was a i do know if he was winterless think it was lead in towards markestan an
d there's three rounds in emma in this in this fight and in between the second and the third round i got in the ring got in the cage wit
h jeremy and i i did befall on you know it is face and ill i know i gave him the alison this is what's going on this guy crossing from u
s taken money off your kids tablelike food off your kid tawaina take you on the roof off their heads you take in everything that you wor
k for he's going to take it from you right now you got to get pistonrod him and i got you i got giafar up speech like that and you coul
d see it switching in eyes he realized like he went into a rage of idikut guillotine out that round and knocked him out yander them an
d that's a an i'll tell you another one i saw that was it was the same so it was it was carlos condit verses roaring mc donald and this wa
s an this was the first time they fought i put yer was again and i was there i forget who is cornering but i was there and i was done wit
h cornerers cornering and i was things peter siboni was corner he was up in canada but am so carlos conduct were rowing mcdonald and carlo
s who's the veteran is going up with kinked know rodion awinkin of an a livin unknown but he was definitely the younger attesters old yo
u are just a kid no offence rory but he was young you don't hate mean bad as for young and cornwallis the vat you don't even oweenee grow
n man with a wife and kids and man will rest getting the better for an front of roy's home town well i don't have his home down but it wa
s a canada hansard was absolutely supporting rory least am pretty sure i remember this right of sorry if i don't but it seemed like th
e crowd was on the side of roary mc donald he so in between tones watching the fight but i had snaked a really good seat in orderly coul
d for matey when i go to c thanks dan a white and the rest of the crew like ice niketas awesome sets after i get a corner yet people s
o thankyou so i was sitting you know in the second row or something to nominal see that i'd mocito and because i tell you the chief seat
s when you're when you're gone epoove out to the wants of fontenaye the nose bleed which is is a cool so i just get aggressive attack w
e moved a better petitions which is using the second row wiegand the press box sir so i'm sit down there and a watch in the fight and greg
g jackson is cornering carlos cot it now if you don't know anything about grand jackson he is he's passed like a guy and i've actually a
h go and back in the day going away back in the day when edair competing all the time in the kind of the sole cow seen of grappling w
e would we do every competition there was ane can beat all time grappling my room ever never there so many of them that we do and and 
a great jackson would bring eyes out to to fight to compete in a like we wrestled against these guys i know a week did observing as h
e astounded from that and then surprising me one time when the us was in san diego i was that worn at the heel poems and some one calle
d and said haters there's a guy from the u s c here do want to give him a tour of you know he wants a toronto have to set up a tour of th
e selem they want shubrick the futility of her who it is you know the whenever some some guns you know just the gear whatever susanite aco
n and you know we kind o had a little bit of recognition but a anyway greg jackson and you know you kind o hear this stuff about greg jack
s and all the time that he is this really nice guy and that he is super mellow that he's really humble well if all reenters a supe
r disguise he super humble he's just a fantastic die and ah i gave a torn so we kind o got to know each other and then you know going fas
t forward now in the ouse i i of cornered him several times on one time i've quarter against him you know antinomy fighters or fighting hi
s fineried said he's a really like a really mellow and eenie i if you watch me the corners of his fights he's always like that josey stead
y and hay this is what you need to do yet watch out for this or whatever some watching this fight and like i said carlos content personate
d carlos's not winning rites not winning and it between a the second in the third round gregan goes full besure i mean he is yellow at hi
m he is in his face he point out of his wavin his finger he is going not on him and i was i be grajaos is bringing the heat and sure enoug
h he and up calconcillos connect and finished roar in the third which is a fight he was definitely in a loose so what you see there he i
s the motion helping to win in that situation is and ah actually before the fight was over i saw greg and i discoosed something to him yo
u know like they did you want for with her obinangoes me and he said i see i had to do it it is funny you could see it i wanted like he'
d never done it before i know meanwhile have grandon at some point he can tonsoribus he said something a long while if you don't like i ha
d to do it in and in it it were a teetotaler smile on and that was working it and it deftly indeed it did work yet and those would you h
e think i'm in this pool gas but do you think that's because those just have him to be the exceptions or is it because really the formul
a kanitseeno like hers the motion and then here's all the logic in the skill and the planning implementation of of you know galitsin al
l the all the stuff that you're going to use in your in your mind and here the motion it's like like a little smart blood or something i
n an am these ly motion can go up but the skill otago up proportionately and once you'd start to do this when the motion takes over that'
s one you know when you're going to fail her or you take advantage tainters sweet spot in there where for moments in time emotion and eve
n border lining on rage with i think range is a little bit strong cause i think rage you lose your clarity let anger which is you can stil
l have some clarity of what you're doing right so i think you can actually that can be utilized appropriately at the right times and 
i think these times you know what the dorotee you know i had to provoke some anger out of him he you know i had to provoke an absolutel
y helping us gone that fight and is a same thing with carl's calls absolutely good i lose that fight ividint do something different if h
e didn't you know it's like it's like it in the turbot it's like it up when i jesooit is not going taintable the night you saw side blowe
r it's only got a get you get me so can make you go a hard for another yet not isn't another to mittel without necessities not dry long a
t all acteau with but with anger you know we can make you go for another m you know ever may be it may be it's too minute and this i
s something else have you er missed like a heavy single like like you at your letting your dad left angornou donolan or something and yo
u miss the heavy signal a nineveh done no i have heard a herd o si so this is another easy way to prove it man i miss i have signal
s sometimes and sometimes i just get an gratuities to bring the anger he and i start getting fired up and i start thinking about thing
s that make me angry you know and i get all that barn out ripped that thing off the floor like a hate it yes he and it absolutely makes m
e stronger that moment so is that a jest probably a dreadlessly the same thing that pampinea's or orenge man's head its front the sam
e thing that part pumpin the carlos i had but it's crazy because despite punched de spiking a beaten despite having some one you kno
w trying to destroy you in fort of a large crowd of people none of that was able spireas all spark tejon inasmuch as some kind of a paten
t the notional portion of your mind i bring out just enough rage to get out there and get that job done once for all yes and the end that'
s really the key there just enough for age especially when you're talking about em something that requires technique when you say liftin
g your your like porkenham and um i remember i was in in college and i was going for my one rimac and yet you feel a couple of times bu
t for the sake of saving time and stuff you can avail to give you three times won't in my case the there were like forget it three times u
m so the first time i'd gotten all of them i was a pretty solid at partlins that time so's getting all of them and then i got to that poin
t em and i didn't get it is three hunt three hundred i weigh one eighty five at the time a toiney eight are you looking for promp
t righteous that protestations proper memory is talking arrebo when you name dropped and stuffiness i did no i did not on purpley treefern
s if ereford it cotton my way to leave out that number true true you know you want it to know you wanted to know a much is doing i do yo
u anisotoma ter for now you want it already way doesn't matter none the less the first time i failed and it was like no he'll cut thi
s you've got this in and had this getting run wood whose name a publind hair like us like you just tough accedit reward and you you alway
s get nuts and you like you can't is you didn't you all hear as this and then you make any matter whatever and i didn't outwardly expres
s any kind of anger but i felt that anger and politikes technique done the thing it's not like it's just um you know like one i come t
o meeting bench has some to any but ever left this is miss er everything i seknebtunis a little bit more technique than other less you ye
a so it was jeff the perfect amount average you know nescafe a want in a person you are like every stevens he could tell just even the wa
y he trains the hesse rag in there yet you oupos to the a roman for example seemingly at an don't watch him trinitarian but it seems lik
e he's so periodical in arragon or anger whatever is it is a asmuch of a part and some one like dumanet with a with a problem like craz
y all yes what are the borges manderton is the way they trained up there at ristori i spent like those to the week end alike hathaway o
r whatever with them with for as an am and rory and it heat froshets head you know that will hold me tsim sure is the hold me iseult as hi
s head that you hit the head instead of the mid aloft seems like all that's not that like it seems kind of obvious i never seen the one t
o that and it made weymore beca'se hit midst before and then you when you go to sparklike it it kind of weird you go again used to th
e difference between a heating mit and hating so onstead saw a penetrant these cases chose smart up here in cataracts greedinesse all th
e guys at getting getting a ocean fight man it's also to watch and that that lawler ah mcdonald slight was just a wishes einsamkeit was i

e mediate things in life there is a dicotomy cause it actually take in my opinion two opposing forces to bring it to light it takes bot
h emotion and logic for outreach your match maximum potential to to really give everything you have and go beyond your limit because bot
h emotionality going to reach their limitations you and one fails egeline other one so when it doesn't make sense logical sense to go o
n that's when you got to use your motion eateese that agerhaus tion that fear to pastureage the push erself to say i don't stop and whe
n your feelings are screaming as you had enough and when you think you're going to break emotionally you override that a motion with th
e concrete logic stand will power that says you don't want i don't stop it to you you fight the weak amoton with the power of logic and o
f fight the weakness of logic with the power of emotions and in the balance of those to nat's where you find less strength and coast an
